//! The control-plane side: opening a channel, shaking hands, asking one thing.
//! Every method here is one channel and one RPC (design-runner.md R4), and each
//! starts by proving the peer is there before it starts the longer clock for
//! the request. That is the two-clock discipline R5 asks for, made real by
//! [`Channel::rearm`] rather than asserted: a peer that never answers the
//! handshake is killed in seconds, and a peer that answers and then takes a
//! while is given the time the work needs.
