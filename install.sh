  # (`h5i-browser-light`) and is now linked into `h5i`, which execs itself to
  # become it. That removed three things at once: a default install that left
  # `h5i browser open` with nothing to render a page, a version skew between two
  # halves of one protocol with no handshake between them, and a box that could
  # read the engine without being allowed to exec it.
  # `h5i` first, always: `--websec` registers its plugin by running the h5i
  # this loop has just installed, so the order is a dependency, not a
