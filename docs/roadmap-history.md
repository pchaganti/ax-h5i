# ROADMAP history: h5i as a contained agentic development environment

Superseded 2026-08-27 by the browser positioning in
[`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md), and kept because the machinery it describes
exists and is tested. Read it as the reference for the box, the worktree, the
viewer, the share path and the phases that built them, not as the product's
framing. Where it disagrees with `ROADMAP.md`, `ROADMAP.md` wins.

Sections 1 to 12 are the environment: scope, architecture, phases, and the
decisions behind them. Section 10 holds decisions taken, section 11 what was
open when this was current. Live code still cites these numbers, so they keep
their identifiers.

The status notes below were written while this was the live plan and are
preserved as written.

**M0 through M5 are built. M6 is mostly built. M7 (the terminal viewer) is
built but undriven.** What is not done, stated plainly so it is not read as
finished:

- The exit criteria for M4, M5 and M7 have none of them been demonstrated with
  a real agent or a real person in the loop. Every piece each of them needs is
  built and tested.
- The control lock is not enforced on the agent's side (section 11.1).
- `npx skills add` is unverified, for lack of a Node 22 runtime.
- There is no demo video.
- `/blog/` and `/pitch/` still argue the old positioning.

M7 earns a read for one thing beyond its own feature. It found that **every
human takeover through the web viewer had been silently doing nothing** since
M5, for the same reason two of M4's findings existed: a message the other side
never dispatches looks exactly like enforcement and enforces nothing (5.10.1).

## 1. The new one-liner

> Give coding agents full autonomy to build and test web apps inside a
> disposable environment, without exposing your machine or your credentials.

The product is a **contained agentic development environment**: a throwaway box
that holds the code, the agent, the toolchain, the dev server, and a real
browser, with nothing of the host inside it and nothing leaving it except a
reviewed patch.

PR review stays as the sharpest demo and the first buyer workflow ("run outside
or AI generated code safely"), but it is no longer the product boundary. A PR is
just one way to fill the box.

## 2. Five components

Everything we build maps to exactly one of these. Anything that maps to none is
out of scope.

1. **Disposable workspace.** The code is *copied* into the box: a PR, an
   existing repo, a fresh project, and every dependency it pulls. No host
   directory is mounted read write into the agent's reach.
2. **Sandboxed coding agent.** Claude Code or Codex, its child processes, MCP
   servers, package managers, builds, tests, and the dev server all run inside
   the same boundary. A runaway agent stays in the box.
3. **Credential and network broker.** No SSH key, GitHub token, model API key,
   cloud credential, Docker socket, or personal browser profile enters the box.
   A host side broker authenticates the calls the policy allows, and egress is
   an allowlist.
4. **Browser in the box, two interfaces.** Chrome and its profile live inside.
   The agent drives it through a CLI; the human watches the same viewport and
   can take over. The host browser never connects to the target app.
5. **Output gate.** At the end you export a patch, a report, screenshots, and an
   execution receipt, after inspection. The agent has no direct write path to
   the host.

The value is not any single one of these. It is that code, agent, dev server,
browser, and export sit inside one boundary that both the agent and the human
can operate.

## 3. Scope cut

### 3.1 What survives

- `crates/h5i-sandbox/` in full: `sandbox.rs`, `sandbox_policy.rs`,
  `container.rs`, `supervisor.rs`, `seccomp_notify.rs`, `cgroup.rs`,
  `secrets.rs`, `secrets_broker.rs`, `auth_proxy.rs`. This is the moat.
- `crates/h5i-core/src/env.rs` as the lifecycle engine, minus its couplings
  (see 3.3).
- The container profile model: `.h5i/env.toml`, isolation tiers, `net.egress`
  allowlist plus the host side CONNECT proxy, resource limits, env allowlist,
  the tee shim observation path.
- `containers/Containerfile.agent-{claude,codex}` as the base for the agent box.

### 3.2 What goes

Every subsystem that exists to record provenance rather than to contain
execution:

- CLI surfaces: `capture`, `recall` (log, blame, objects, search, context,
  memory), `audit`, `compliance`, `maturity`, `vibe`, `team`, `orchestra`,
  `msg`, `pr`, `notes`, `push`/`pull`/`share`, `serve`, `mcp`, `resume`,
  `status`, `doctor`, `migrate-remote`, `setup-remote`.
- Modules: `repository.rs`, `blame.rs`, `metadata.rs`, `ctx.rs`, `msg.rs`,
  `team.rs`, `memory.rs`, `prompt_score.rs`, `attention.rs`, `recap.rs`,
  `review.rs`, `risk.rs`, `rules.rs`, `compliance.rs`, `radio.rs`, `pr.rs`,
  `lfs.rs`, `session_log.rs`, `ui.rs`, `server.rs`, `vibe.rs`, `resume.rs`,
  `mcp.rs`.
- The MCP server in full, including the `h5i_env_*` tool family. 3.0k lines in
  `mcp.rs` plus its CLI entry point, and with it the `#![recursion_limit =
  "512"]` in `lib.rs`, which exists only for that file's `json!` literal.
- The whole `crates/h5i-orchestra/` crate.
- The embedded web dashboard `web/`, the `plugin/` directory, the `web` cargo
  feature, and the axum dependency.

  **Partly reversed, 2026-08-05.** The dashboard's twelve provenance views are
  gone for good, but its *Sandbox* view was the one screen that described boxes
  rather than commits, and losing it left no way to see the fleet at a glance.
  `web/`, the `web` feature and axum are back, scoped to that one screen and
  nothing else: `h5i ui`, read-only (every route is a GET), loopback-only and
  token-gated, built on manifests, the resolved policy, the env event log and
  `receipt.rs`. `risk.rs` is *not* back. The badges are arithmetic over
  receipts, so nothing on the screen is a score. See `crates/h5i-core/src/server.rs`.
- Git notes, `refs/h5i/{notes,context,memory,msg,team}`, and the sharing
  machinery over them.

Rough size: the workspace is ~95k lines of Rust today, of which `h5i-core` is
~63k and the root binary ~14k. The target after the cut is a binary plus two
crates in the 20k to 25k range.

### 3.3 The couplings that make this real work

`env.rs` is 9.2k lines and does not stand alone today. It reaches into:

| Coupling | Where | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crate::objects` evidence captures | run/shell capture, `ingest_shell_spool` | new `receipt.rs`: a box local, append only JSONL of commands, exits, timings, egress hosts, file diffs, with the same secret redaction |
| `crate::ctx` reasoning branch | `pin_worktree_context`, `fork_branch_no_switch`, context merge on apply | drop. The reasoning branch is a provenance feature, not a containment feature |
| `crate::msg` / `crate::team` | env inbox, `submit`, `submit_review`, `record_agent_reply` | drop with the orchestra |
| `crate::repository` git notes | `H5I_NOTES_REF` reads and writes on propose/apply/inspect | drop. Export carries the receipt as a file, not as a note |
| `crate::msg::sanitize_display` | terminal injection defense on untrusted strings | keep, move into a small `redact.rs` next to the receipt writer |

The mediated commit path validation in `env.rs` (canonicalized `$WORK`
allowlist, nested `.git` rejection, symlink escape rejection, gitlink round
trip) is not provenance. It **is** the output gate, and it moves to the export
path unchanged.

## 4. Command surface

```
h5i box .                    # snapshot the current repo into a box
h5i box <repo-url>           # clone an external repo into a box
h5i box --pr <N|url>         # review a PR in a box
h5i box --new                # empty box, agent builds from zero

h5i box ls | status <name> | rm <name> | gc
h5i box shell <name>         # attach a confined interactive session
h5i box run <name> -- <cmd>  # one policy enforced command
h5i box view <name>          # open the human viewer for this box
h5i box export <name>        # inspect and emit patch, report, receipt
h5i box probe                # host capability report
h5i box allow <host>         # persistent egress allowlist entry
h5i box cache ls|refresh|rm  # per project warm dependency caches

h5i browser status|take|release   # the control lock, and who holds it
h5i browser url  # the viewer URL for this box

h5i skill install|show|path      # write or print the embedded agent skill

h5i ui                           # the box console: the whole fleet, read-only
```

`h5i dev *` and `h5i env *` stay as hidden aliases through one release, then
are removed. The command is `box` because that is the noun everything else uses.

The non-interactive lifecycle verbs (create, run, export, ls, status, and the
rest of the reporting set) take `--json` and emit a stable envelope on stdout,
human notes on stderr: that contract is the programmable surface an SDK would
wrap, and it is specified in 6.2.

**Driving the browser is `agent-browser`, not `h5i`** (7.). Inside the box the
agent runs it directly:

```bash
agent-browser open http://localhost:3000
agent-browser snapshot                     # accessibility tree with @refs
agent-browser click @e2
agent-browser fill @e3 "test@example.com"
agent-browser screenshot shot.png
```

h5i's own browser surface is deliberately three verbs: the control lock, and
the viewer URL. Wrapping forty automation verbs would buy nothing but drift.

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Workspace: copy in, not mount

Today `$WORK` is a real git worktree on the host, bind mounted into the
container at `/work`. That is convenient and it is the wrong boundary for this
product: a container escape or a careless `--mount` reaches host files, and the
worktree keeps the host repo's `.git` in the blast radius.

Target: the box gets a **copy**. Sources are a `git archive` of the working
tree, a clone of a URL, a fetched `refs/pull/<n>/head`, or nothing. The copy
lives in a container volume owned by the box. The host repo is opened read only
at creation time, and never again during the run.

Consequences to design for:

- Round trip is by patch, not by shared inode. Export writes a patch the host
  applies. Nothing writes into the host repo without a human step.
- Dependency install happens in the box, once, and the box keeps its own package
  caches. Warm caches across boxes are a committed feature, designed in 5.8.
- The kernel tiers (`process`, `supervised`) keep the worktree backend, since
  they have no volume abstraction. `container` becomes the default tier for
  `h5i box`, and the copy in model is container only at first.

### 5.2 Where the browser runs

The first draft of this section put the browser in a second container and
reached for a Podman **pod** to share a network namespace with the agent. That
was the wrong starting point, for two reasons found while planning M4.

**One: the supervised tier already has stronger network scoping than the
container tier.** `supervised` puts the box in a private network namespace and
enforces `net.egress` with **nftables rules pinned to resolved IPs**, DNS
pinned by a hosts file, and a seccomp-notify gate on `socket()`. That is L3/L4:
a program that ignores proxy settings still cannot reach an off-list address.
The container tier's allowlist is an HTTP/HTTPS CONNECT proxy, which only binds
proxy-respecting tooling. The container tier buys **portability**, not tighter
network control, and this document said the opposite for two drafts.

**Two: one box is simpler than two.** Put the browser in the *same* box as the
agent and the dev server on `localhost:3000` is reachable with no netns
sharing, no pod, no port publishing and no second image. At the kernel tiers
the "image" is the host filesystem under Landlock grants, so the browser is a
profile change: grant Chrome and the agent-browser binary, and launch the
daemon inside the box.

So M4 targets a single supervised box:

```
box (supervised)   private netns, nftables egress allowlist, Landlock, seccomp
├── the agent, its builds and tests, the dev server on localhost:3000
├── headless Chrome (no X: --headless=new)
└── the agent-browser daemon, driven over the CLI
```

The container tier is the **portability** path, and once the browser lives in
the same box it costs almost nothing: an image with Chrome and agent-browser
(`containers/Containerfile.browser`), a `/dev/shm` big enough for a renderer,
and the host-path grants skipped because the image provides them. All three are
built. The pod split was the expensive part, and dropping it took the cost with
it.

One thing this costs, and it should be stated: our seccomp deny-list blocks the
namespace syscalls Chrome's own sandbox needs, so Chrome runs with
`--no-sandbox` inside the box. h5i's box is the boundary, not Chrome's; the
same is true under rootless Podman. It is a real reduction in defence in depth
and it belongs in the limits section rather than in a footnote.

### 5.3 Browser control

The automation itself is **agent-browser** (7.), running inside the `browser`
container. h5i does not reimplement clicking. What h5i owns is everything
around it:

- The daemon and its CDP port stay inside the box's network namespace. Nothing
  is published to the host; the human viewer reaches the stream through an
  h5i-owned forward with a per box token (5.9).
- Chrome runs with a **fresh profile created in the box**. No host profile, no
  host cookie jar, no host extension, no host history.
- Chrome's egress is the box's egress: at `supervised` that is the nftables
  allowlist, which needs no cooperation from Chrome at all. Loopback stays open
  so the dev server is always reachable. agent-browser's own
  `--allowed-domains` is set from the same policy as a second, in-process
  layer.
- **AI features off.** agent-browser's `chat` and the dashboard's AI panel send
  page content to an external gateway. In a box that is an exfiltration path
  with a friendly name, so `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is never injected and `chat` is
  refused by policy.
- Downloads, uploads, and clipboard resolve inside the box. A download lands in
  `/work/.h5i/downloads` and is subject to the export gate like any other file.
- Every browser command, plus console and network errors, lands in the receipt.

### 5.4 Control lock

Neither agent-browser nor CDP arbitrates between two clients: the agent's CLI
session and a human typing into the stream can both dispatch input at the same
moment, and the result is a mess neither of them can reason about. The lock is
h5i's, and Neko's `request / release / take / give / reset` is the semantic
model we copy.

- The agent holds control by default.
- A human interaction in the viewer takes control. Automation pauses at the next
  command boundary, and the next agent browser command returns a typed "control
  held by human" error rather than fighting for the pointer.
- On release, the agent must re snapshot before acting, because the DOM it
  remembers is stale.
- Exactly one automation client per box. Multi agent shared *control* is out of
  scope: two clients steering one browser is a race with no arbiter, and the
  control lock exists precisely so it cannot happen. This says nothing about
  several boxes coordinating — see part T, whose whole design is that agents
  exchange information and never share a driver, a credential, or a grant.

### 5.5 Credentials

- Model API: the key stays on the host. `auth_proxy.rs` already injects it into
  outbound requests from the box, scoped per runtime, so a Claude box cannot
  reach the OpenAI credential or vice versa. Keep, make it default on rather
  than opt in.
- **Any other service: the same mechanism, generalized.** An earlier draft of
  this section proposed a GitHub "capability helper": a host side process
  serving a fixed verb set (fetch a PR head, read issue text, open a draft
  PR). That is the wrong shape for this repository. It overfits h5i to one
  vendor, and the next request is GitLab, then Jira, then whatever else, each
  adding vendor code to a tool whose job is the boundary.

  The general primitive is the one already here: a **host side proxy that
  injects a credential for an allowlisted host and never lets the box hold
  it**. Generalize `auth_proxy.rs` from "the model API" to "any host named in
  the profile, with a credential resolved host side", and GitHub becomes a
  policy entry rather than a feature:

  ```toml
  [profile.review.net]
  egress = ["api.github.com"]
  [profile.review.auth."api.github.com"]
  header = "Authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}"   # resolved on the host
  ```

  **The shape this has to take is a decision, not a detail.** `auth_proxy.rs`
  today is a *reverse* proxy: the box is handed a base-URL override
  (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) pointing at a loopback listener that injects the real
  credential and forwards to one pinned upstream host. Generalizing it has two
  candidate shapes, and they are not equivalent:

  1. **Reverse proxy per grant** (small, honest, limited). The profile names a
     host, the env var holding the credential host side, and the base-URL
     variable the client respects. Nothing new is invented: it is the existing
     mechanism with the hard-coded runtime table replaced by profile data. The
     limit is real and must be stated: it only works for clients you can point
     at a different origin, so `curl https://api.github.com` still goes nowhere.
  2. **Forward proxy with header injection** (general, expensive). `HTTPS_PROXY`
     plus per-host injection means terminating TLS in the proxy, which means a
     CA the box trusts. That is a substantially larger security surface: a box
     that trusts an h5i CA is a box whose TLS you have taken responsibility for.

  Option 1 is the one to build first, precisely because its limit is legible.
  Option 2 should not be reached for until something concrete needs it, and
  when it is, it needs its own design note rather than an afternoon.

  Restricting *what* the box may do with that credential is authorization, and
  it belongs where it is already solved: a fine-grained token, scoped to one
  repository and the operations you meant. If a generic rule is wanted later it
  is a method/path condition on the proxy, still policy data, not vendor code.
  Vendor ergonomics (a friendly `gh`-shaped CLI) belong in a separate tool.

  Worth noting how little is left after that: `h5i box <pr>` already fetches
  the PR head **host side, before the box exists**, so the demo workflow needs
  no credential in the box at all.
- Everything else routes through `secrets_broker.rs` with a per grant record.
- Per env HOME state already exists (`prepare_home_state`, `policy.home_binds`)
  and is a copy of the host agent config, seeded once, never written back.
  Audit what that copy actually carries and strip anything credential shaped
  from the seed rather than trusting the copy.

### 5.6 Output gate

`h5i box export` produces, after showing a summary and asking:

- `patch.diff`: the tree diff, path allowlisted to `$WORK`, no nested `.git`, no
  symlink escapes, no agent introduced gitlinks. Reuses today's mediated commit
  validation.
- `report.md`: what the agent says it did.
- `screenshots/`: what the browser actually rendered.
- `receipt.json`: commands with exit codes and wall or CPU or RSS, egress hosts
  contacted and which were denied, files touched, policy digest, image digest,
  and the tier that was actually enforced.

Secret redaction and size caps apply to all four. The receipt is the honest
part of the export: it is generated from observation, not from the agent's
account of itself.

### 5.7 Receipt integrity

The receipt is generated **inside** the box, by the shell shim and the browser
daemon. That is acceptable, and the only property that has to hold is that the
agent cannot rewrite what has already been recorded.

Today that property comes from **sealing, not from an fd**, and it is already
true:

- The box's write window under its env directory is exactly `<env>/spool`. The
  receipt log (`<env>/receipt.jsonl`) and the stored payloads
  (`<env>/receipts/`) are siblings of that spool, outside every grant. The box
  stages a record; the host ingests it. There is no path from inside to a
  record the host has already written. (`prepare_env_capture_spool`, pinned by
  a unit test and an integration test.)
- Ordering and timestamps are the host's, applied at ingest.
- Two fields are host observed and never taken from the box: process exits and
  resource usage come from the supervisor's `wait4`, and egress comes from the
  allowlist proxy's own log.
- Every record carries the **lane** that observed it (`host-env-run` is host
  observed; `tee-shim` and `inbox-capture` are box claimed), so the two kinds
  of evidence never blur together.

What an agent can still do is stage *extra* records, or stop writing. Both are
visible: a gap between host observed exits and box reported commands is itself
a receipt finding. We do not claim more than that, and the docs say it in these
terms.

An inherited-fd writer (records streamed to a host collector over a pipe, no
file in the box at all) remains the stronger design, because it also removes
the staging window. It is worth doing when the container tier's spool becomes
the common path, not before: the sealing argument above already covers the
"cannot rewrite" half, which is the half that matters for trust.

### 5.8 Warm caches

Cold dependency install is the difference between a 20 second box and a four
minute box, so caches are in scope rather than deferred.

- One cache per project and ecosystem, keyed by a digest of that ecosystem's
  lockfile set, under `.git/.h5i/cache/<eco>/<key>/`. **Built** (`h5i box cache
  ls|mounts|rm`, `crates/h5i-core/src/cache.rs`, unit tested). A cache whose
  key no longer matches the project is listed as stale and never handed to a
  box: packages resolved for a different dependency set are a silent, hard to
  explain wrong answer.
- Mounted **read only** into the agent box at the ecosystem's cache path
  (`~/.cargo/registry`, `~/.npm`, `~/.cache/uv`, …). A read only cache is a
  correctness problem for nothing: every package manager falls back to fetching
  what it cannot find. **Built**: `ResolvedPolicy::ro_binds` (runtime-only, never
  serialized, so it cannot move a pinned digest) is applied as `MS_BIND` then
  `MS_REMOUNT | MS_RDONLY` on the kernel tiers and as `--mount ...,ro` at the
  container tier. `h5i box cache mounts` prints exactly what a box would get.
- Writing to a cache happens only in a dedicated `h5i box cache refresh` box,
  which runs the install step alone, with egress narrowed to the registry hosts
  and no agent inside it. The cache is populated by a build, never by an agent
  session. **Built**: `ResolvedPolicy::cache_write` is a single optional
  writable bind, produced only by `h5i box cache refresh` and reachable from no
  profile, so an agent box cannot make its own cache writable. The bind targets
  the same path the read-only mount later exposes, so what is fetched is
  exactly what a later box sees, and the throwaway box is removed whether the
  fetch succeeded or not.

  One thing refresh cannot do for you: no built-in profile fits it. `default`
  denies network (it is the build/test profile) and the agent profiles grant a
  model API instead, so a refresh box needs a project-declared profile whose
  egress is the registry hosts and nothing else. `refresh` refuses with that
  profile written out, ready to paste, rather than creating a box whose fetch
  could not have worked.
- `h5i box cache ls|refresh|rm` are the whole surface. A box records which cache
  volume and which digest it used, in the receipt.

This keeps the property that matters: no mutable surface is shared between an
agent box and anything else.

### 5.9 The viewer forward

agent-browser's stream server assumes a friendly localhost: connect to the
WebSocket and you can both watch and type. Inside a pod that is fine, because
nothing else is in the pod. It is not fine on a developer machine with a
browser on it.

So the port is never published. `h5i box view` starts a small forward the host
owns. It reaches into the box's private network namespace the same way the
supervisor already does (h5i is the parent process and holds the pid), rather
than by opening a hole in the netns:

- It binds `127.0.0.1` only, on a port h5i chose, and prints the URL.
- Every connection presents a **per box token**, minted at box creation and
  never written into the box.
- It refuses cross origin WebSocket handshakes, so a page the human happens to
  have open cannot reach into a running box.
- It enforces the control lock (5.4) on the input direction: frames flow out
  always, input flows in only for the holder.

That is the whole trusted surface between the human and the box, and it is
about as small as this can be made.

### 5.10 The terminal viewer

**Built** (`crates/h5i-core/src/termview/`, `h5i box view --term`). The web
viewer reaches the human through their host browser, which leaves one awkward
beat in the story: everything runs in the box, except the watching, which
happens in the most credential-laden program on the host. The terminal viewer
closes that beat. It renders the boxed viewport in the terminal itself, in a
split pane next to the agent, and over SSH when the box host is remote. It is
also the demo the launch needs: one recording showing agent, dev server, and
boxed browser in a single terminal frame.

The line for the story is: **the browser is untrusted, the terminal is the
trusted path.**

**It is not a client of the forward, and that changed during the build.** The
first plan had the TUI connect to `h5i box view` over loopback with the per-box
token. That is a listener and a credential bought for nothing: the viewer runs
in the same process as the CLI the human typed, so it can do what the forward
does: fork, enter the box's user and network namespaces by pid, connect, and
take the socket back over `SCM_RIGHTS`. So `--term` binds no port, mints no
token, and serves no page. There is nothing for another local process to
connect to, so there is nothing to authenticate. The forward keeps its token
because it must listen; this does not.

What it is made of, and what each part is for:

- **`ws.rs`**: a WebSocket client, roughly the RFC 6455 subset one connection
  to one server needs. Everything the box sends is untrusted: reserved opcodes
  and reserved bits are refused, a masked server frame is refused, lengths are
  capped before they become allocations, and fragmented messages cannot grow
  past the cap across frames.
- **`proto.rs`**: the stream's messages. Pinned to what agent-browser actually
  dispatches (`input_mouse` / `input_keyboard` / `input_touch`) rather than to
  what the DOM calls them, for reasons in the bug note below.
- **`image.rs`**: `zune-jpeg`, which forbids unsafe code, with dimensions
  capped before decode. Frames are scaled to the pixel size they will actually
  be displayed at, because every byte crosses a PTY and over SSH that is the
  whole cost of the viewer.
- **`kitty.rs`**: the graphics protocol, generated **by the viewer and only by
  the viewer**. `q=2` on every render command, so the terminal's replies never
  land in the middle of the keystrokes being translated into page input. Direct
  transmission only: the file and shared-memory mediums are faster and only
  work when the terminal is on this machine.
- **`input.rs`**: terminal bytes to CDP events, including the two places a
  terminal and a browser genuinely disagree: a terminal reports presses with no
  releases (so the pair is synthesized, and press-and-hold does not work), and
  it reports cells rather than pixels (so clicks map through the placement, at
  cell resolution).
- **`status.rs`**: the row the page cannot reach.
- **`term.rs`**: raw mode, alternate screen, mouse and bracketed paste, all
  behind an RAII guard that restores on every path out.

Three properties worth stating plainly:

- **The viewer generates every escape sequence.** The box supplies compressed
  pixels inside a WebSocket message and nothing else. Terminal output is an
  escape surface (OSC 52 clipboard writes, title and hyperlink control, the
  graphics protocol's own file-reading mediums, parser bugs), and no byte from
  the box reaches the PTY. This is `sanitize_display` applied to pixels instead
  of strings.
- **A trusted status line.** Row one is the viewer's: box, mode, lock holder,
  origin, egress, console errors. A page cannot draw there, and it cannot be
  clicked through into the page either. The origin is sanitized on the way in
  (escape sequences *and* bidi overrides, which needed a fix in `redact.rs`, since
  they are not control characters and the existing pass let them through) and
  it is never the field that gets truncated: a URL too long for the row loses
  its path, and an origin too long for the row is cut from the **left**, since
  shortening `bank.example.evil.test` from the right is the spoof itself.
- **Two modes, because a terminal makes them natural.** VIEW is read-only and
  leaves the mouse to the terminal, so selection and scrollback still work.
  INTERACT takes the control lock: reaching for the controls *is* taking them,
  which is the lock's own rule and the only sensible one here, since the
  terminal is busy being the viewer and there is no other window to run
  `h5i browser take` in. `Ctrl-]` is reserved to get back out, because raw mode
  hands the viewer every other key.

**Still open, and deliberately not built yet.** LOGIN mode, withholding frames
and snapshots from the agent while a human types a credential, rests on the
agent-side enforcement decision in 11.1, and shipping it as advisory would
overstate it. Pixel-resolution mouse reporting (`?1016`) would place clicks
better, but a terminal that does not support it keeps reporting cells with no
way to tell, which is the quiet-wrong-answer shape this codebase keeps getting
bitten by. The file and shared-memory transmission mediums are the local
fast path. tmux passthrough is untested.

And the claim, at its real size: this shrinks the TCB of *watching*, it does
not add a boundary. "The box cannot send escape sequences to your terminal"
already held for the web viewer, because the box cannot reach the PTY at all.
The delta is that a small Rust module plus a memory-safe JPEG decoder replaces
a host Chrome tab as the thing doing the watching, plus the status line and the
mode model that only a terminal makes possible. The stronger "entirely
untrusted guest" framing waits for the microVM backend, like every other claim
of that shape.

**terminal-browser (zenbu-labs, MIT) is the reference, not the base.** Its
architecture runs Chromium *on the host* (Electron offscreen rendering, a
native input helper, macOS only today), which is the trust inversion of ours,
and its hard problems are the ones h5i has already solved on the other side of
the boundary. What we took is the Kitty graphics rendering technique and the UX
patterns; what we did not take is Electron on the host, a host Chromium, or an
input helper.

#### 5.10.1 The bug this work found in the web viewer

`viewer.html` sent `mousedown`, `keydown`, `wheel`, the DOM event names.
agent-browser's stream server dispatches on `input_mouse`, `input_keyboard` and
`input_touch`, and falls through to `_ => {}` for everything else. So **every
human takeover through the web viewer was a no-op**, and silently: the socket
stayed healthy, frames kept arriving, and the forward counted the input frames
as forwarded. The receipt would have recorded "a human drove this box" for a
session in which nothing a human did reached the page.

M5 verified the *gate* (input dropped without the lock, forwarded with it) and
that is exactly what it verified; nothing checked that a forwarded frame moved
anything. It is the same class as the M4 findings: a variable the tool never
reads, a message the server never dispatches. Both look like enforcement and
enforce nothing.

Fixed, with the correct message names, CDP's string button names, a
`clickCount` (a press with zero is not a click as far as Chrome is concerned),
and `text` omitted rather than nulled on key-up. Pinned by a test that reads the
page and refuses a DOM event name. The stale control indicator was fixed at the
same time and for a related reason: with input working, a display permanently
reading "agent" would tell someone who had just taken the lock that it had
failed. There is no channel to push updates on, since the stream is a straight relay,
so the holder is stamped into the page at serve time and the page says that
is what it is.

### 5.11 Share: the first inbound path (built, 2026-08-10)

Everything else in this document is about what leaves the box. Share is about
what comes in: a second person, on their own machine, trying the web app the
agent built while it still runs inside the box. The demand is the ngrok use
case ("here, click around") without the part where a tunnel URL quietly
exposes a dev server that was never meant to face the internet, and without
standing up an account, a domain, or a server of ours.

**Port sharing, not viewer sharing, and that is a use-case decision.** Two
shapes were on the table. Sharing the *viewer*, the agent-browser stream of
5.9 carried over the network instead of loopback, reuses the forward and the
terminal viewer almost whole, but it ships pixels: one viewport, one control
lock, no independent navigation, no devtools on the other end, no feel for the
app's own latency. Sharing the *port* puts the real app in the other person's
own browser, which is what "try it" means. The viewer share is a different
feature (a joint review session), not a cheaper version of this one, so it is
not a prerequisite and does not gate this; if it lands later, it lands on the
same bridge.

**The bridge is the feature; transports are plugins under it.** `h5i box
share` starts a host-side process with three jobs, none of which depend on how
the bytes travel:

- **Reach the dev server.** The box's port is never published. The bridge
  enters the box's network namespace by pid and dials loopback per connection,
  exactly the seam the viewer forward and the terminal viewer already use
  (5.9, 5.10). Nothing inside the box learns *who* is visiting: a quick tunnel
  hands its origin `Cf-Connecting-Ip`, `Cf-Ipcountry` and `X-Forwarded-For`,
  and the gate drops every one of them before the box sees a byte, because a
  person who clicked a link agreed to look at a page and not to identify
  themselves to somebody else's agent. What the box can tell is that it is
  behind a proxy: `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` stay, because a dev server
  builds its URLs out of them and a share that broke every link on the page
  would not get used. The netns
  gains no hole, and the box's egress policy is untouched: the bridge is a
  host process, outside the boundary, like the CONNECT proxy.
- **Hold the capability.** A ticket minted at share time is the whole access
  model: it names the box, the port, an expiry, and a secret; possession is
  authorization, and possession is all of it: a ticket is a bearer capability,
  so forwarding the text admits everyone it reaches under the one grant.
  Measured, because this line used to claim the opposite: two `h5i join`
  processes on one ticket both reached the dev server and both appear in the
  receipt against the same grant. Mint one ticket per person if you want
  `h5i box share revoke` to cut off one person rather than all of them; `stop`
  ends the session for everyone. No account on either side. (As shipped, minting a
  second ticket works on `--tunnel` shares only; see 5.11.1.)
- **Write the ingress receipt.** Every lane in 5.7 observes egress. This is
  the first inbound evidence: peer, connection times, requests proxied, bytes,
  and the transport actually used (direct, relayed, tunnel), in the same
  receipt the export already carries. A share session that left no record
  would be the one part of a box's life the receipt is silent about, which is
  exactly the kind of gap this document exists to refuse.
- **Measure time with a clock nobody can move.** Ticket expiry and the
  session length are elapsed time, not wall-clock subtraction. A backward NTP
  step was measured putting an hour back onto every live grant and writing a
  receipt that read `0s` for a two-minute session with `closed` before
  `opened`. The timestamps in a receipt are still clock readings and can be
  wrong; the receipt says so on a `clock` line when they are, because an
  evidence artifact that quietly clamps an absurdity to a plausible number is
  worse than one that admits it.

**Transport one: iroh.** Peer-to-peer QUIC, end-to-end encrypted, NAT
traversal with public relays as fallback for the hard cases; the relay sees
addresses and volume, never plaintext. The ticket carries the node addressing,
so there is nothing to configure. `--direct-only` refuses to move application
bytes over a relay: a peer that cannot get a direct path is turned away, and the
share stays up for anyone who can.
The other end runs `h5i join <ticket>`, which terminates the QUIC connection
and serves the app on the joiner's loopback, and that listener repeats 5.9's
lesson on someone else's machine: a bare local port is reachable by every page
and process the joiner has open, so the local URL carries a token and the
proxy refuses without it. iroh is a real dependency tree (QUIC, TLS), so it
is a cargo feature in the `web` pattern: default on, and a build without it
loses `share`/`join` and nothing else.

**Transport two: Cloudflare quick tunnel, because the joiner may not be a
developer.** P2P requires `h5i` on both ends, and the person you most want
clicking the prototype (a designer, a PM, a customer) will not install a
CLI. `h5i box share --tunnel` shells out to `cloudflared` and hands back a
plain URL any browser opens. The same bridge still fronts it: the URL embeds
the ticket token, the bridge checks it and the expiry on every request, and
revocation still works mid-session. The capability degrades from "hold the
secret" to "hold the link", not to nothing. The honest costs, which the docs
must state rather than blur: TLS terminates at Cloudflare, so this mode is
not end-to-end and Cloudflare can read the traffic; `cloudflared` is an
external binary we neither pin nor ship; and quick tunnels are explicitly not
a production service (concurrency caps, no SSE). It is the no-install mode,
not the default mode.

**What the joiner is exposed to, stated up front.** The app being shared is
agent-written, untrusted code, and port sharing renders it in the joiner's own
browser. That is the point, and it is also the exposure, the same one as
clicking any link a colleague sends. One asymmetry is worth writing down: in
P2P mode the app is served from the joiner's loopback, and a loopback origin
is exempt from the browser's private-network protections, so a hostile page
has an easier path at the joiner's own local services than the same page on a
public origin would. Tunnel mode, ironically, keeps those protections, because
the origin is public. `h5i join --isolated`, opening the proxy in a box of the
joiner's own, is the strong answer for a joiner who has h5i anyway; it should
exist, and it should not be pretended that the no-install audience will use
it.

**What this is not.** Not a deployment path: sessions are bounded by the
ticket's expiry and die with the bridge. Not a relay business: the public iroh
relays are someone else's rate-limited infrastructure, fine for fallback and
for measuring how often fallback actually happens, and running or selling
relay capacity is a SaaS with an abuse desk attached, out of scope by the
same decision that says no server (10.). And not the old `share`: 3.2 deleted
a `push`/`pull`/`share` that moved git notes between repositories; this one is
`h5i box share`, on the box noun, and the collision ends there.

The surface, as built:

```
h5i box share <name> [--port 3000] [--expire 60m] [--label alex]
h5i box share <name> --direct-only               # refuse relayed app bytes
h5i box share <name> --tunnel                    # cloudflared; plain URL
h5i box share ls|status|grant|revoke|stop
h5i join <ticket> [--port N]                     # the other machine
```

#### 5.11.1 What shipped, and what it cost to be honest about

`crates/h5i-share/`, ~12k lines with 187 tests, behind a default-on `share`
feature on the binary and a default-on `p2p` feature inside the crate (iroh 1.0,
`tls-ring` only). A `--no-default-features` build has no `share` verb rather
than a broken one, and `--no-default-features` on the crate alone keeps the
tunnel transport with no QUIC stack compiled in.

Four decisions made during the build that the proposal above did not contain:

- **The fork into the box happens once, at startup, and the helper stays.** The
  viewer forward forks per connection, which is fine for one WebSocket and wrong
  for a share: a share runs an async runtime, and `fork()` in a process with a
  thread pool inherits one thread plus whatever locks the others held. So
  `Dialer::spawn` runs while the process is still single-threaded and keeps a
  helper alive in the box's namespaces, answering a one-byte "connect me" over a
  socketpair. Belt and braces on top: everything below the fork is
  allocation-free (stack-built `/proc/<pid>/ns/…`, `SocketAddr` rather than
  `(&str, u16)`), so a caller who ignores the ordering rule gets a helper that
  cannot deadlock rather than one that does so occasionally.
- **A box with no network of its own is refused, not shared.** Without one,
  "the box's port 3000" and "this machine's port 3000" are the same port, and
  sharing it would publish whatever happened to be listening. This is the one
  refusal in the feature that exists purely because the alternative is a silent
  wrong answer. The condition checked is "is there a process of this box in a
  network namespace of its own", not a list of tiers: a `process`-tier box gets
  one when its profile denies egress and shares the host's when it does not, so
  a tier list would be advice that is wrong half the time. The message names
  which of the two things is missing: no session, or no network.
- **Authorization is per connection, read from disk, and revocation has a
  watchdog.** `share revoke` runs in a different process, so a cached grant table
  would be a revoke that appeared to work. On the P2P path it is per *stream*,
  which means one TCP connection into the box: a revoke stops the next one. For
  the connections already open, a one-second watchdog closes them. Without that
  second half, revoking would work on everyone except the person actually there.
- **A share carries at most 64 connections into the box.** Refused rather than
  queued, because a queue turns a flood into latency for the person who is
  legitimately using the share and hides that anything happened; and answered
  with a `503`, not a `401`, because "your link is bad" is the wrong thing to
  tell someone whose link is fine. The count goes in the receipt on its own
  line, so load and credential failures never read as each other.
- **One connection carries one request, because connection pools are shared.**
  Both HTTP fronts gate a connection when its first request arrives, which is
  equivalent to gating every request only if a connection cannot carry a second
  one. It can: `cloudflared` pools connections to the origin and reuses them for
  the next request from *any* visitor, and browsers pool per origin the same
  way, so an unauthorized request could ride in on a connection someone else's
  credential opened.

  The first version of this sent `Connection: close` upstream and called it
  enforcement. It was not: the box runs agent-written code, and a dev server
  that answers keep-alive leaves the front holding an ungated pipe. The second
  review caught exactly that, so the front now reads the head plus the declared
  body and then **stops reading the client**, which needs nothing from the box.
  Two things fall out. A chunked request body has to be *parsed* rather than
  just copied, because forwarding one request means knowing where it ends and a
  chunk stream only says so in its own framing. It was refused with a `501`
  for two rounds, which meant no streamed upload worked at all. And an upgrade
  earns its two-way pipe only after the box answers `101`,
  with the request required to carry both `Upgrade` and `Connection: upgrade`.
  A lone `Upgrade:` header is something any client can attach to a request that
  will never upgrade, and it was an opt-out from the whole rule.

  A third round found the other half: the *response* was relayed untouched, so a
  box answering keep-alive told the visitor's browser to reuse a connection this
  proxy would never read again: an intermittent hang, and a `502` for every
  POST a client will not retry. The response head is rewritten to `close` now
  and framed by its `Content-Length`. Security intact throughout; liveness had
  been traded away silently.

  All three rounds are worth recording together: nothing in the suite would have
  caught any of them, because nothing in the suite pools connections. The tests
  that pin them run against a dev server written specifically to ignore
  `Connection: close`.

- **Per-port cookies fixed one leak and opened another.** Naming the joiner's
  cookie after its port stopped two `h5i join` sessions logging each other out.
  It also meant a *second* share's credential was, from any given front's point
  of view, just another cookie, and cookies ignore the port, so the browser
  sent both to both, and each front dutifully forwarded the other's to
  agent-written code. Reading our own cookie by exact name and dropping every
  cookie whose name starts with the share prefix are two different rules, and
  the difference was the one property the gate exists for. The test that had
  been written for the first fix asserted the leak as correct behaviour, which
  is the more useful lesson: a test can pin a bug as a feature.
- **Revocation is per grant all the way down.** The watchdogs first asked
  whether the *share* was spent, which is true only when no grant admits
  anybody, so revoking one peer while another was still connected left the
  revoked peer's open streams running, and the CLI printed "any connection that
  peer had is dropped within a second" while that was false. Each connection now
  watches the grant that admitted it. Same class of thing as `--direct-only`,
  which was checked once at setup and never again: a direct path can die and
  iroh will fall back to a relay, so a promise checked once is a preference.
  Both are polled for the life of the connection now.
- **Streams are served concurrently, and that was a real bug first.** The first
  cut awaited each stream to completion before accepting the next, which
  serialises every share behind whichever connection is longest-lived, for a
  dev server, the hot-reload socket that never ends. Found by the in-process
  end-to-end test hanging, which is the argument for having written it.

**Not built, deliberately.** `h5i join --isolated` (opening the shared page in a
box of the joiner's own) is designed in this section and has no implementation;
the warning at join time is what stands in for it today. Viewer sharing is not
built and was never in this milestone.

**Not built, and it is a gap rather than a choice.** `h5i box share grant` mints
a second ticket for a *tunnel* share only. A P2P ticket needs the running
endpoint's addressing, and only the serving process has it, so the verb refuses
rather than handing out a ticket that names nowhere. The procedure that works is
to stop the share and start a fresh one, reissuing tickets to everybody
including the peer already connected; a *second concurrent* share is refused by
`session::claim`, so it is not a way round this. Closing it needs
the serving process to answer a request from another process, which is a channel
this feature does not otherwise need, so it waits for someone to want it.

## 6. Distribution: the CLI is the product, the skill is the interface

`h5i` is a single Rust binary with no server, no daemon, and no SaaS. That makes
the distribution story short, and it means the **agent facing interface is a
skill**, following the pattern already used by `h5i-db`:

```bash
npx skills add h5i-dev/h5i     # installs the skill from skills/h5i/
```

Repository layout to converge on:

```
skills/h5i/
  SKILL.md                    # one page: when to reach for a box, the loop, the guardrails
  references/
    boxes.md                  # create, run, shell, status, export lifecycle
    browser.md                # the h5i browser verb set and the snapshot format
    policy.md                 # profiles, egress, caches, what is and is not enforced
    export.md                 # the output gate and reading a receipt
    troubleshooting.md        # probe output, tier fallbacks, common denials
```

Notes on shape:

- **The skill replaces `.claude/h5i.md` and `plugin/`.** Both are Claude Code
  specific and predate the pivot. One skill, runtime neutral, is the single
  place the usage rules live.
- **Two audiences, one skill.** The host side agent needs "make a box, hand work
  to it, read the export". The in box agent needs "you are inside a box, here is
  `h5i browser`, here is what is denied and why". SKILL.md routes between them by
  checking `$H5I_BOX` rather than shipping two skills.
- **The skill does not install the binary.** `npx skills add` writes Markdown.
  The binary keeps `install.sh` plus prebuilt release artifacts, and the agent
  images bake it in. SKILL.md's first line has to handle "the binary is missing"
  without guessing.
- Skill prose is under a total budget, the way `h5i-db`'s is: SKILL.md stays
  around 100 to 150 lines and pushes detail into `references/`, which are loaded
  only when needed.

### 6.1 The binary carries the skill

`skills/h5i/` is embedded into the binary at build time (`include_str!` over the
directory), and the CLI can write it back out:

```bash
h5i skill install [--target <dir>] [--runtime claude|codex|cursor]
h5i skill show [<reference>]      # print SKILL.md or one reference page to stdout
h5i skill path                    # where an install would write
```

This is how the in box agent gets the skill, and it removes the two bad options:
nothing is baked into the image, and nothing is copied from host to box.

What it buys beyond convenience:

- **No version drift.** A skill that documents flags the installed binary does
  not have is worse than no skill. Embedding makes the skill a property of the
  binary, and `h5i skill install` stamps the version it wrote.
- **The in box copy can be box specific.** `h5i skill install` inside a box
  knows the tier that was actually enforced, the egress allowlist, the cache
  mounts, and whether a desktop is attached. It can render the policy section
  with the real values instead of describing the general case. An agent that is
  told exactly what is denied stops trying to work around it.
- **`h5i skill show` is a cheap in context lookup.** A reference page on demand,
  from the binary, with no file to find.
- **Bootstrap becomes one line.** Box creation runs `h5i skill install` as part
  of its own setup, alongside the profile and the shell rc it already writes.

`npx skills add h5i-dev/h5i` stays as the front door for people who do not have
the binary yet. Same bytes, since both come from `skills/h5i/` in this repo, and
a test asserts the embedded copy matches the checked in one.

### 6.2 The programmable surface: a JSON contract first, an SDK second

The model is `remote-agent-browser` (Vercel Labs, `~/Ref/remote-agent-browser`).
Its whole SDK is about 1,200 lines of TypeScript: spawn a command in the
sandbox, parse the JSON envelope, hand back a typed result. The programmable
experience developers like lives almost entirely in the CLI's machine readable
output, not in the wrapper. That is the order of work here too: the contract is
the product, the SDK is packaging.

**No daemon.** The SDK spawns the `h5i` binary as a subprocess and parses
`--json` output. This keeps the "one Rust binary, no server" decision intact,
and it does not conflict with the No MCP decision: MCP was cut because it put a
host side *agent* inside the box's interface. An SDK puts the developer's
*orchestrator* on the host and the agent in the box, which is the direction
`box run` already serves.

**The JSON contract.** Every lifecycle verb an SDK would call takes `--json`
and emits a stable envelope on stdout, with human notes on stderr. As of
2026-08-05 that covers the full loop: `create` (the manifest, same shape as
`status --json`, plus the workspace path), `run` (box id, policy digest,
capture id, exit code, timing, peak rss, the recorded redacted output, and the
full receipt record; the exit code still passes through), `export` (the export
summary: files changed, patch bytes, receipts, denied egress count,
redactions), plus the verbs that already had it: `list`, `status`, `diff`,
`log`, `inspect`, `compare`, `capabilities`, `doctor`, `secrets`, `ports`,
`allow`, and `--version`. This is scriptable today from shell, CI, or an
agent's Bash tool, with no SDK at all.

**The SDK mapping is mechanical.** `create()` is `box create --json`, `exec()`
is `box run --json`, `browser.run([...])` is `box run -- agent-browser ...`
(the daemon is already in the box, so no new host-to-box channel exists),
`diff()` is `box diff --json`, `export()` is `box export --json`, `events()` is
`box log --json`, `close()` is `box rm`. One deliberate omission: an
`agent.run(prompt)` that shells out to a per-call headless `claude -p` is the
wrong primitive. If the SDK grows an agent handle it should hold a resident
session (a `box shell` it can send to and wait on), and the first release can
ship without it: exec, browser, diff, and export are enough for the derivative
projects that matter (PR screenshot bots, dependency evaluators, visual
regression CI, browser-use evals).

**Sequencing.** The contract lands now. `@h5i/sdk` (TypeScript, a postinstall
that fetches the release binary the way esbuild and biome do) waits until the
first buyer workflow has been demonstrated end to end, because the SDK
amplifies a story that has to exist first. Python follows demand, not the
roadmap. The acquisition logic: every third party repository whose README says
`npm install @h5i/sdk` is distribution, and the closest fit between the
boundary's value and an SDK consumer is CI (run an untrusted PR, build it,
drive it in the box's browser, post the screenshots and the receipt).

## 7. The browser layer: agent-browser, not a viewer of our own

An earlier draft of this roadmap had us reimplementing Neko's capture, encode
and input core in Rust so the human could watch the box. That plan is dropped.
**agent-browser** (Vercel Labs, Apache-2.0, `~/Ref/agent-browser`) already is
both halves of what we needed, and it is a native Rust CLI:

- **Automation.** `open / snapshot / click / fill / press / hover / select /
  scroll / screenshot / eval / wait`, plus semantic locators (`find role button
  click --name "Submit"`). Snapshots are accessibility trees with `@e2` style
  refs, which is exactly the token-cheap shape a model needs. It speaks CDP
  directly: no Playwright, no Node at runtime.
- **The human viewer.** Every session runs a WebSocket server that streams the
  viewport as JPEG frames (CDP `Page.startScreencast`) **and accepts input
  events back** (`Input.dispatchMouseEvent` / `KeyEvent` / `TouchEvent`). Their
  own words for it are "pair browsing where a human can watch and interact
  alongside an AI agent". Frame quality, size and rate are tunable per box.

What that buys us, beyond not writing it:

- **The desktop stack disappears.** No Xorg, no GStreamer, no PulseAudio, no
  window manager, no supervisord. Headless Chrome plus one binary. The browser
  container drops from a Neko-runtime-sized image to something an agent box can
  reasonably carry, and the attack surface shrinks with it.
- **One less protocol to design.** Frames and input already have a defined
  WebSocket message format, and there is a reference client (their dashboard) to
  check ours against.
- **It matches our distribution model.** Native Rust, installable via cargo or
  npm, and it ships a skill of its own.

What stays ours, and it is not small:

1. **The boundary.** The stream port and the CDP port never leave the box's
   network namespace. The viewer is reached through an h5i-owned forward with a
   per box token (5.9). agent-browser assumes a friendly localhost; we do not.
2. **The control lock** (5.4). Two clients can dispatch input at once and
   nothing upstream arbitrates. That is ours to enforce.
3. **Policy.** Fresh profile, proxy settings, `--allowed-domains` derived from
   `net.egress`, AI chat disabled, downloads landing under the export gate.
4. **Receipts.** Browser commands, console errors and failed requests are
   evidence and belong in the receipt like any other observation.

The cost is a third-party dependency on the critical path. We pin a version,
depend on the **CLI** surface rather than internal APIs, and keep the fallback
in view: it is Apache-2.0 Rust, so vendoring or forking stays available if the
project moves somewhere we cannot follow.

**Neko is not gone, it is deferred.** CDP screencast shows the page viewport and
nothing else. The day the product needs a real desktop (a native app under
test, browser chrome, a file picker, devtools as a human sees them), an X plus
streaming tier comes back, and Neko is the reference design for it. Nothing in
the boundary, the lock or the receipt changes when it does.

### 7.1 Two engines, one policy (proposed, 2026-08-07)

A survey on 2026-08-07 (Cloudflare's Kitesurf announcement, Lightpanda, and a
read of agent-browser upstream) changed what "the browser" can mean here.
Kitesurf is a browser engine rewritten for agents: Rust (Blitz for HTML and
layout, Stylo for CSS, Boa for JS) compiled to WASM and run as disposable
isolates behind a single egress worker that owns every network request and
every cookie jar. It passes 215,000+ Web Platform Tests, speaks CDP and MCP,
treats every page load as untrusted input, keeps no persistent authenticated
sessions, and Cloudflare says it will be open-sourced for self-hosting.
Lightpanda (Zig, html5ever plus V8, CDP) is the same camp, and agent-browser
upstream already selects between Chrome and Lightpanda with `--engine`. The
part that matters to us is not the cloud: it is that non-Chromium engines an
agent can actually use now exist, and the ecosystem has converged on CDP as the
interface, so an engine swap does not orphan the tooling.

The h5i-shaped observation: **our egress proxy is a blind CONNECT gate, so
browser receipts can only name hosts.** The proxy sees
`CONNECT docs.example.com:443` and nothing else; the evidence for "what did
the agent read" is whatever the post-run console drain catches. An engine whose
network stack *is* our proxy inverts that. Every request and response becomes
first-class evidence, per-request policy needs no MITM CA because we are the
client, and for untrusted origins script execution can be off entirely, which
removes the delivery channel for most page-borne prompt injection instead of
trying to filter it.

Stated precisely, because Chromium can get partway there: CDP's Fetch domain
lets a mediator pause every request Chromium makes and allow, deny, rewrite or
record it, so request-level receipts and per-request policy are available on
the Chromium path too, through the M8 sidecar (7.2). What a mediator cannot
make them is **fail-closed**: attach races, freshly created targets and
workers, event buffer limits and disconnects all mean CDP coverage is
monitored rather than guaranteed. The engine's claim is narrower and stronger:
if the log is not running, the request does not happen, and a page script is
never evaluated unless a profile line granted it, checked before evaluation
rather than filtered after. With a JS engine in the binary the honest words
are "off by default, gated by policy"; "absent by construction" is reserved
for a `--no-js` feature build, if one is ever worth cutting.

The model this points at is **two engines, routed by origin, one policy**:

- **Loopback, the agent's own dev server: Chromium.** Verifying that a modern
  app renders, hot-reloads and runs its client-side code is the hardest compat
  case there is, and the content is the agent's own code. Fidelity wins, and
  today's stack stays exactly as built.
- **The untrusted web (docs, search, issue trackers): the light engine.**
  Reading rarely needs a JIT, receipts matter more than pixels, and the model
  wants a tree, not a frame. Containment wins.

Two things fall out of this split without being built. **Video and WebGL
never enter the light engine's scope**: a coding agent testing a video player
is testing its own app, which is loopback, which is the Chromium path, where
both already work. Kitesurf has to name them as gaps because it has no
Chromium half; we do. And **authenticated sessions, Kitesurf's other stated
gap, are answered by the control lock we already ship**: the agent hits a
login wall, the human takes the viewer, logs in, hands back, and the agent
resumes from a fresh snapshot (5.4). Watching stays the default posture and
input stays an explicit take; a local-first tool with a human present should
use that human, not imitate a cloud service that cannot have one.

The routing rule lives next to `net.egress` in the profile, not in the agent's
moment-to-moment choice: the agent must not get to pick the weaker-policy
engine for a hostile page. Two degenerate profiles fall out for free:
`browser` as it exists today (Chromium only, nothing changes), and a
`browser-lite` with no Chromium at all: no Chrome preflight, no 12 GiB limit,
plausible at the microvm tier where the Chromium stack has never been proven.

The staged path, cheapest first:

1. **Engine as a profile knob.** agent-browser already abstracts the engine;
   a profile field that sets `--engine lightpanda` costs almost nothing and
   changes no seam we own (socket dir, egress env, evidence drain all stay).
   What it buys is the real data: where a light engine actually breaks on our
   loop, before we bet anything on one.
2. **Origin routing.** agent-browser is one engine per daemon session, so
   per-origin routing means either two sessions with h5i choosing at navigate
   time, or our own layer in front (7.2 builds that layer for other reasons).
   This step is a design decision, not a big build, but it is honest to say
   the session model does not give it to us for free.
3. **The lightweight visual engine.** A crate of ours: Blitz and Stylo for
   parse, layout and paint, Boa (off by default, policy-gated) for the
   minority of pages that need script, and fetch wired directly into the
   egress proxy's stack so the receipt *is* the network log. Beyond fail-closed logging, an owned engine can bind what no
   mediator can: a human-approved form submission mints a **single-use
   capability** for that origin and those fields, page script cannot spend it,
   and every request carries its provenance (agent, human, or page script) as
   a structural fact instead of an inference over event timing. **Assembled,
   not written**: the component stack is the same open-source Rust Kitesurf
   builds on, and the build-versus-adopt call waits for Kitesurf's open-source
   drop before choosing which pieces are ours.

What we do not do is write HTML, CSS, JS or rasterization primitives from
scratch: the engine is assembled from Blitz, Stylo and Boa, focused on what
an agent needs. Section 7's argument is unchanged: Chromium plus
agent-browser stays the fidelity path, docs-grade pages are the light
engine's compatibility bar rather than React, and the light engine earns its
place on the strength of receipts and a containment story Chromium
structurally cannot give us.

**Superseded in part, 2026-08-08.** The survey above is accurate and still
worth reading; its *conclusion* is not. "Two engines, one policy" assumed
routing lets a box avoid Chromium, and it does not:
`sandbox_policy::browser_read_grants()` chains every engine's candidates, so an
`h5i-light` box grants Chrome's and agent-browser's paths anyway and the
environment still installs and updates Chromium. Routing saves runtime RSS and
nothing else. §12 records the decision that replaced it: one local engine that
runs script and renders on demand, with Chromium kept as the fidelity fallback
rather than as the answer to "what about JavaScript".

### 7.2 Owning the daemon socket (proposed; the interception point open item 1 asks for)

Open item 1 records that the control lock is advisory because no h5i process
sits between the agent and agent-browser. The upstream read says the
interception point exists and is small: the daemon's entire control surface is
newline-delimited JSON over one filesystem-bound `AF_UNIX` socket,
`{"id", "action", ...}` in, `{"success", "data", "error"}` out, one line each
way, every action serialized under a single mutex. That is a protocol a
supervisor can hold in a few hundred lines.

The shape: the daemon's real socket moves to a path the box has no grant for,
and the path the box is given (`AGENT_BROWSER_SOCKET_DIR`) carries an
h5i-owned listener that forwards line by line. The design consequence is that
the daemon stops being an in-box child and becomes an h5i-launched sidecar,
because a daemon spawned by the agent's own CLI can only ever bind where the
agent can also reach. That is the shape the macOS shim already has (h5i
launches Chrome itself and attaches agent-browser to it), so it is a
convergence, not a fork; and it must not move the boundary: the sidecar stays
in the box's netns, under the box's egress, with nothing published.

What one mediated socket buys, in order of value:

1. **The lock becomes real.** `control::check` runs on every mutating verb,
   and `HeldByHuman` / `NeedsResnapshot` come back as the daemon's own typed
   error. Read-only verbs pass untouched, which is exactly the split 5.4
   wants: watching never collides.
2. **Per-action receipts.** navigate, click, fill, eval land in the receipt as
   they happen, with their arguments. Today's evidence is a post-run console
   drain; this is the action log, and it is the browser-side analogue of the
   egress tally.
3. **A browser action policy.** Upstream's `ActionPolicy` (allow / deny /
   confirm over action names, about 200 lines) is the right vocabulary, worth
   adopting as a per-profile manifest: `eval` deniable, `credentials_*` and
   `state_*` deniable, and a `confirm` tier for consequential actions, which
   is where the whole field landed on injection containment (per-site grants
   plus human confirmation). The confirm channel is the viewer.
4. **The CDP side of the same sidecar.** Owning the daemon means owning its
   browser, so the sidecar can attach CDP `Fetch.requestPaused` and give the
   Chromium path request-level evidence and per-request policy: method,
   origin, initiator and verdict in the receipt, not just the CONNECT line.
   This lane is recorded as best-effort, because CDP coverage fails open
   (7.1); the fail-closed version of the same lane is M10's reason to exist.

The honest costs: an h5i process on the browser hot path; a dependency on the
daemon's wire protocol, which is an internal surface, against section 7's
stated preference for the CLI boundary (mitigated the same way: pinned,
forkable, and the protocol is one page); and the sidecar launch is new
lifecycle code where today the daemon manages itself.

## 8. Phases

Each phase ends with a green `cargo test` and a demo that runs on a stock
rootless Podman host.

> **Suite status, 2026-08-05.** `cargo test --lib` is green across the
> workspace (391 tests, of which 66 are the terminal viewer's) and clippy is
> clean with `--all-targets --all-features` and with `--no-default-features`. Three `env_integration` tests fail on this WSL2 host with a
> worktree-stat error (`box_git_grants_stay_fail_closed_outside_env_namespace`,
> `box_git_status_and_commit_work_inside_process_tier`,
> `process_tier_confines_fs_and_network`). They fail identically at
> `e4488b064`, before any of this work, so it is host drift rather than a
> regression, but it is drift nobody has diagnosed, and the process tier is
> not actually covered here until someone does.

### M0. Freeze and branch: done

`dev` is the integration branch and this
roadmap is on it.

### M1. Amputation: done

Section 3.2 is deleted (~77k lines). `receipt.rs`,
`refstore.rs`, `redact.rs`, `source.rs` extracted; `env.rs` is free of
`objects`, `ctx`, `msg`, `team` and `repository`. The whole lifecycle works
with no git notes and no context refs, clippy is clean over the workspace, and
the `web` feature is gone rather than off.

### M2. `h5i box` and copy in: done

New command surface with `env` aliased
(short form, `ls`, hidden alias). Export gate replacing `propose`/`apply`
(patch + report + receipt bundle, refuses to overwrite). `h5i skill install`
from the embedded skill. Receipt integrity by sealing, with the test that pins
it (5.7). All four sources: this repository, a pull request, a repository URL,
and `--new`.

The copy-in landed as **detached boxes**: for a URL or `--new`, the box gets a
git repository of its own inside its directory, the host repository is never
touched (no branch, no worktree, no objects), the inherited `origin` remote is
dropped so the box cannot reach a network handle nobody granted it, and `apply`
and `rebase` refuse and point at `export`. That is the boundary the phase was
for, and it holds on every tier rather than only under a container volume.

### M3. Agent in box hardening: done

Warm caches in full: the store, the
lockfile keying, the staleness rule, `h5i box cache ls|mounts|rm|refresh` and
the **read-only mount** on every tier are built and tested (5.8). (An earlier
revision of this line said `refresh` was not built; it landed in e75020358,
with the writable bind reachable from no profile and the refusal that names the
registry-only profile it demands.)
Also done: the credential-seed audit (the per-box HOME copy now drops
credential-shaped entries at any depth (`credentials*`, `.netrc`, ssh keys,
`*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.p12`), keeping only the runtime's own token, which it cannot
function without), and the credential proxy, which was already default-on but
did not engage for a `browser` box.
Also done: profile-declared authenticated egress (5.5, option 1): a reverse
proxy per grant, the credential resolved host side and never placed in the box,
part of the pinned digest, and fail-closed when the host-side variable is
unset. GitHub is a policy entry, not a feature. Option 2 (a TLS-terminating
forward proxy) stays unbuilt and unneeded.

### M4. Browser: done

The live runs were worth more than the code around them. What they found, in
order:

1. ~~**The `supervised` + agent-profile `EINVAL` happens when the box's
   workspace is under `/tmp`**, because the agent profile redirects `/tmp` to a
   per-env scratch and that shadows the worktree.~~ **Wrong, and withdrawn.** A
   `create`-time refusal for that layout was written and it rejected this
   suite's own fixtures: every `tempfile` repo is under `/tmp`. Checked
   directly instead: a supervised box whose workspace is under `/tmp` sees its
   workspace, runs commands, and drives the full browser loop. The bind-ordering
   fix in 86dddafe0 (mount `/tmp` last) had already handled it. The working
   behaviour is now pinned by a test rather than guarded by a phantom.
2. With that out of the way, a `browser` box at `supervised` creates and runs,
   and `agent-browser --version` answers from inside it.
3. `agent-browser`'s daemon put its control socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
   (`/run/user/<uid>`), which no box has a write grant for, and failed with
   "Failed to create socket directory: Permission denied" long after create
   said everything was fine. **Fixed**: `AGENT_BROWSER_SOCKET_DIR` now points at
   the box's own `/tmp`, which every tier grants and the kernel tiers make
   per-env.
4. `agent-browser doctor` **from inside a box** is the tool for the rest of
   this, and it immediately caught a bug in our own policy: pinning
   `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` to an empty string *enabled* chat, because
   agent-browser tests for the variable's presence. The box reported
   "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY present (chat enabled)", the opposite of the intent.
   **Fixed** by not injecting it at all (it is not in `env.pass` either, so it
   is absent), and verified from inside: "chat command disabled".
5. Doctor also confirms the profile's grants work: **Chromium 130 is found** at
   the granted `~/.cache/ms-playwright` path.
6. **The daemon exited during startup with no output, and it was our socket
   gate, not Chrome.** The supervised tier notifies on `socket()` and denied
   `AF_UNIX` unconditionally, with no way for a profile to ask for it; the
   daemon's control socket is a filesystem-bound `AF_UNIX` listener, so it got
   `EPERM` on the first thing it did. `Profile::unix_sockets`
   (`[profile.X.net] unix = true`) is that way to ask, and `browser` sets it.

   The grant is narrower than it sounds, which is why it can exist: abstract
   sockets are scoped by the private netns, filesystem-bound ones by Landlock,
   and `/tmp`, where `.X11-unix`, `tmux-*` and an ssh-agent live, is a per-env
   scratch at the kernel tiers. The residual is a host socket under a granted
   path, so it stays opt-in per profile and lands in the digest.

   The silence was upstream's, and worth recording: the daemon redirects its own
   stderr to `/dev/null` before failing **unless** `AGENT_BROWSER_DEBUG` is set,
   in which case it writes to `$AGENT_BROWSER_SOCKET_DIR/<session>.log`. That log
   is the only place the real error appears; `--debug` alone does nothing.

7. **Two variables we set were not variables agent-browser reads.**
   `AGENT_BROWSER_HEADLESS` does not exist (it is `AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED`, and
   headless is what a falsey value means), and neither does
   `AGENT_BROWSER_DISABLE_CHAT`: chat is gated on `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
   presence alone. A variable the tool never reads reviews as enforcement while
   enforcing nothing, so both are gone and the tests assert their absence.

Nothing here could have been found by reading the code, which is the argument
for driving the loop before building more on top of it.

That gap, **no test in the suite ran an agent-family profile at
`supervised`**, the only kernel tier that can host an agent or browser box
(`process` refuses the egress the profile needs), is why both surprises were
available to find, and it is now closed. The test that would have caught the
daemon failure asserts both directions: a `browser` box binds a
filesystem-bound `AF_UNIX` listener, and a `default` box on the same host and
tier still gets `EPERM`, so the grant cannot silently become tier-wide.

Built: the `browser` built-in profile (the agent profile plus the browser
surface, runtime scoping intact, egress never wider than the agent's),
host-path discovery for the kernel tiers with a fail-closed create that names
what to install, `containers/Containerfile.browser` for the container tier, and
`/dev/shm` sized from the policy so a renderer does not die on Podman's 64 MiB
default. **No pod, no second image, no Podman requirement** (5.2).
`--allowed-domains` is derived from the enforced `net.egress` (plus loopback,
which never appears in an allowlist but is the whole point of a dev server),
headless is pinned through the variable that actually exists, and the AI gateway
is refused by absence, the only mechanism upstream has.

**Browser evidence in the receipt** is built (`crates/h5i-core/src/browser.rs`).
After a run that drove the browser, h5i asks the page what happened and records
the console errors, uncaught exceptions and failed requests, then surfaces them
in `report.md` above the agent-authored proposal. Four properties make it
evidence rather than decoration: h5i picks the moment, a host-side cursor keyed
to a session fingerprint keeps each record to its own slice, a browser command
with no browser to ask is recorded `unavailable` rather than as a clean page,
and a host-side socket check keeps the drain from *starting* a browser just to
report an empty console.

Verified live on a supervised browser box against a page that logs a console
error, throws a `TypeError` and fetches a missing URL: all four findings reach
the receipt, the export bundle and `report.md`.

Exit criterion **not yet demonstrated**: an agent fixing a real UI bug using
only agent-browser output as its feedback. Every piece it needs is built and
proven by hand; nobody has run the loop with an agent in it.

### M5. Viewer: done

The control lock
(`crates/h5i-core/src/control.rs`, `h5i browser status|take|release`): the
agent holds control by default, a human *takes* it rather than asking, and
handing it back sets a stale-handle flag that refuses the agent's next mutating
action until it re-snapshots. Read-only verbs stay available throughout,
because watching never collides. Nothing upstream arbitrates this, which is
why it is ours.

The forward (`crates/h5i-core/src/view.rs`, `h5i box view`, `h5i browser url`)
serves the agent-browser stream to loopback. The box's port is never published:
h5i enters the box's user and network namespaces by pid, connects from inside,
and hands the socket back over `SCM_RIGHTS`, the fd-handoff the supervisor
already uses. All four gates verified live against a supervised browser box:
loopback only; a per-box token minted at create and kept outside every path the
box can read or write (401 without, 401 on a wrong one); cross-origin
handshakes refused (403) even with a valid token; and the control lock on the
input direction, with input *dropped* rather than rejected so someone who clicks
before taking control keeps a live viewer. Sessions land in the receipt and the
export under a `viewer` lane, and the report calls out a session where a human
drove.

Three bugs found, all the same kind: quiet failures producing a plausible
wrong answer rather than an error, and each worth remembering:

- The live registry records h5i's **host-side** pid, which is in the host's
  netns. Entering it succeeds, finds nothing listening, and reads as a broken
  box. Fixed by walking the session's process tree for the first descendant
  whose netns differs from ours.
- A stray CRLF in the relayed handshake is not a protocol error the server
  reports. It is two bytes read as the start of the client's first frame, after
  which the handshake completes and the viewer hangs.
- Returning `Result<u64>` from the input pump discarded the forwarded-input
  count on the error path, which is exactly the path a human takes by closing
  the tab. The export would have recorded them as never having touched the box.

Exit criterion **not yet demonstrated end to end**: a human takes over mid-run,
finishes a form, hands control back, and the agent continues from a fresh
snapshot. The takeover, the input gating and the stale-handle refusal are each
verified; a real person finishing a real form is not something this session
could run.

### M6. Skill and story: mostly done

`skills/h5i/` is written against the
real surface and the binary carries it; the missing fifth page
(`references/browser.md`) is written. The README, MANUAL.md, `man/h5i.1` and
`docs/manual/index.html` all describe the product that exists. The manual was
3,900 lines of `capture`/`recall`/`audit`/`team`/`mcp`, and is rewritten around
the boundary. The landing page is rewritten too, and the embedded mock of the
deleted `h5i serve` workbench is gone with its CSS and its film driver. Seven
guides plus `/features/` and `/workflows/` teach deleted commands, so each
carries a banner and is `noindex` rather than being quietly left.

**Remaining**: `npx skills add h5i-dev/h5i` is still unverified: the `skills`
CLI needs Node >= 22.20 and no such runtime was available to test it; the repo
layout and frontmatter were checked against what the CLI discovers. There is no
demo video. `/blog/` and `/pitch/` still argue the old positioning, and
rewriting them means choosing the launch message, which is open question 2.

### M7. Terminal viewer: built and driven

`h5i box view --term` (5.10). The
module is unit tested (the WebSocket client also round-trips over a real
socket), clippy is clean, and the web viewer's silent input bug is fixed and
pinned (5.10.1).

The loop was driven end to end against a live supervised `browser` box serving
a page on its own loopback, on a pty with a real window size: watch, `i` to take
the lock, type and click, `Ctrl-]` to hand it back, `q` to leave. What that
proved, in order: `connect_in_netns` into the box, the WebSocket handshake, real
JPEG frames decoded and scaled (an 800×400 image in 100×20 cells, aspect
preserved, 624 continuation chunks), the previous frame deleted only after the
next was placed, the control lock flipping to `human` and back to `agent`, mouse
tracking taken and returned, the alternate screen restored on a clean exit, and
the status line picking up the page's real URL. The receipt recorded `12
frame(s) forwarded to the page` ("hello" as ten key events plus a press and a
release) and flagged `a human drove this box` from the input count, which is
the take-and-hand-back case that comparing the holder at open and close would
have missed.

Two things it found that no amount of reading would have. A pty with no window
size makes `TIOCGWINSZ` succeed and report zeroes, and the viewer dutifully
scaled the page into one cell and transmitted a **1×1 pixel image** with no
error anywhere; `Size::or_fallback` now supplies 80×24. And the first harness
stopped reading before sending `q`, which is why it looked as though the
alternate screen was never exited, worth remembering as a way to mistake a
test artifact for a terminal-corrupting bug.

Still **not demonstrated**: a real person, at a real Kitty-protocol terminal,
looking at the page. Everything under it is exercised; the last inch is a human
being, and a tool shell is not a TTY.

**Post M7.** A full-desktop tier when something needs more than a page viewport
(X plus streaming, Neko as the reference design), microVM backend, macOS.

### M8. The mediated socket: proposed (7.2)

The agent-browser daemon becomes
an h5i-launched sidecar and its socket path is h5i's listener. Exit criteria:
an agent's `agent-browser click` during a human takeover is refused with the
typed error, not advised; every mutating verb appears in the receipt with its
arguments; a profile denies `eval` and the denial lands in the receipt; and
the Fetch evidence lane (7.2 item 4) shows a granted request with its
initiator and a denied one with its verdict, marked best-effort. This closes
open item 1 and is worth doing before any engine work, because the mediation
layer is where origin routing (7.1) would live anyway.

### M9. Second engine: proposed (7.1)

`engine` as a profile field, pinned
in the digest with its version like any other policy choice, Lightpanda as
the first non-Chromium value. The knob's real shape is "any CDP endpoint",
not "Lightpanda": agent-browser already drives engines over CDP, so this is
the slot M10's binary later fills with no new plumbing, and agent-browser
stays the one automation surface for every engine behind it. The subset an
engine must speak is automation plus the screencast domain
(`Page.startScreencast` / `screencastFrame` / `screencastFrameAck`), because
the whole shipped viewer stack, stream server through terminal panes, sits
downstream of that domain and follows any engine that implements it. **No silent
fallback**: an unsupported page fails closed and names the retry ("this page
needs MediaSource; recreate with `--browser chromium`"), because a fallback
to Chromium is not an optimization, it is a security-policy change: an API
absent by construction in one engine exists in the other, so the box's
capability surface must not move without a create. The engine and its
version land in the receipt. Exit criteria: a `browser-lite` box with no
Chromium installed answers `doctor`, snapshots a real documentation site,
and the full loop's failure modes on a light engine are written down here.
No routing yet: one engine per box.

### M10. The lightweight visual engine: tier 1 built, 2026-08-07

`crates/h5i-browser-light`, a standalone binary: static render, agent
snapshot, screenshot, and the fail-closed request log. Blitz + Stylo +
vello_cpu assembled behind our own broker; 42 tests; clippy clean with and
without default features. Driven live against a local page and a real site.

Built **ahead of its gates**, and that should be said plainly: M9 has not run,
so there is no compatibility data yet, and Kitesurf's open-source drop has not
landed, so the build-versus-adopt call was made without it. What that buys is
a working artifact to measure instead of a design to argue about; what it
costs is that tier 2/3 scope is still guesswork, and the CI lockfile grew by
137 packages to carry the engine.

Two findings from driving it, neither available by reading:

1. **A denied resource must be *completed*, not dropped.** Blitz counts a
   resource pending until its `NetHandler` is called, and `paint_scene`
   refuses to paint while any critical resource is pending, so the obvious
   way to write a deny (return without calling the handler) renders every page
   permanently blank. Fail-closed means "completed with nothing", and there is
   a test on it.
2. **`system-fonts` is a build-time native dependency.** Blitz's font
   discovery pulls `yeslogic-fontconfig-sys`, which needs libfontconfig
   headers to compile: portable engine, non-portable build. Fonts are
   discovered and registered at runtime instead, which also makes "no fonts"
   a state `doctor` reports rather than a blank screenshot nobody can explain.

#### Tier 2, and the numbers

**Tier 2 built, same day.** `h5i-browser-light serve`: a WebSocket that speaks
the viewers' own format (base64 JPEG in a JSON envelope, `status` carrying the
viewport, `config`/`ack` pacing), plus a `.stream` file so the existing
discovery finds it. Scroll and link-click work; a click on a refused link
returns `page_error` and keeps the page. Frames are driven by change, not by a
clock: with no script, at rest the process sends nothing, and an `ack` alone
never produces a frame. Verified with a protocol-level client that does its own
handshake and masking, so the compatibility check is against the spec rather
than against our own encoder.

**The numbers, measured rather than hoped for.** Median of 5 after a warm-up,
same host, self-contained local pages, peak summed RSS across the process tree:

| | one-shot, 39 KB docs page | idle with a page held open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| h5i-browser-light | 72 ms / 33 MB | 37.5 MB |
| chromium `headless_shell` | 356 ms / 479 MB | 383.8 MB |
| chromium (full) | 644 ms / 799 MB | — |

That is ~5x faster and ~15x lighter one-shot, ~10x lighter at rest, so the
memory exit criterion is met in both the states it named. **Superseded — see
§B23.6.** Re-measured 2026-08-30 at ~3x faster and ~7-9x lighter, and *slower*
than `headless_shell` on a script-driven page: this table predates the engine
having a JavaScript engine at all, and h5i's own memory has roughly doubled
since. The measurement was right when it was taken, which is the argument for
dating one. Three caveats travel
with it and belong in any repetition of it: cold start is included and
dominates Chromium's time (fair for a one-shot agent invocation, not a
steady-state throughput claim); the pages carry no JavaScript, so Chromium is
paying for an engine it is not using and a script-driven page would reverse the
comparison entirely; and software rasterisation will narrow the time gap on
heavy CSS.

Still open at this tier: no script; input stops at scrolling and link clicks
(no typing, no form submission); and the live view has been driven by a
protocol-level test client rather than by `h5i box view` against a real box.
What is missing in that last one is the run, not the plumbing.
`H5I_BROWSER_STREAM_FILE` puts the `.stream` under the box's `agent-browser`
directory, which is where the viewers' discovery already scans.

#### What landed after, 2026-08-08

**Tier 2's open item closed.** The live view has now been driven by
`h5i box view` against a real `h5i-light` box rather than by a protocol-level
client: the forward attaches and renders, the console's frame relay pulls a
1280x720 JPEG through the same session, input is dropped while the agent holds
the control lock and flows the moment a human takes it, so the lock is enforced
on an engine with no mediator behind it, which had never been checked. Two
defects fell out of the run, both fixed:

1. **A readable file could fail to open.** `open ./page.html` reported "invalid
   path" when `canonicalize` failed, because the fallback handed a *relative*
   path to `Url::from_file_path`, which refuses one. The walk fails for a
   working directory the box can reach by fd and not by name, which is any
   repo under `/tmp`, since that is the directory the supervised tier
   overmounts. The message named the path when the problem was the walk.
2. **`serve` accepted one viewer at a time.** The accept loop handled
   connections sequentially, so opening the console's page tab left
   `h5i box view` hanging in the backlog with no error. Two viewers could not
   coexist, which nothing had tried.
3. **Scrolling only ever worked on unstyled pages.** The scroll range came from
   the root element's `size.height`, which a stylesheet saying
   `html, body { height: 100% }` pins to the viewport while the article
   overflows it, so Blitz reported Wikipedia's 16477px page as 720px and every
   scroll clamped to zero. The fix reads `size.height.max(content_size.height)`,
   which is the same formula Blitz's own `scroll_viewport_by` uses. Every local
   test page was unstyled, so the whole suite agreed with the bug. Found by
   pointing the thing at Wikipedia, which is the entire argument for doing that.

**The resident session, 2026-08-08 (§12.1).** `serve` now holds a page
that several viewers and a control channel share, and
`h5i-browser-light session status|snapshot|navigate|click` drives it. A control
verb that moves the page broadcasts to every viewer, so the live view shows the
page *the agent* is driving, so the caveat M11a's page pane had to print is gone
for this engine. Ack pacing moved from a structural accident ("one frame per
client message") to per-viewer state, holding the *newest* frame rather than
queueing a backlog, and nothing is encoded at all when no one is watching.

The architecture was chosen by the compiler, not by preference: **`Page` is not
`Send`**: `BaseDocument` holds an `Arc<dyn HtmlParserProvider>` and a
`Box<dyn FontMetricsProvider>`, so the obvious `Arc<Mutex<Session>>` does not
exist. One thread owns the page and everything else reaches it by channel. That
is the shape a multi-driver session wants regardless; here it was not optional.

**Untrusted-content marking, 2026-08-08 (§12.1).** The rendered snapshot
now fences page content and names it as data. Pulled ahead of its position in
the list because §11 called it "the only item on this list whose absence is a
live hole rather than a missing feature" while ranking it fourth, and it depends
on nothing. Writing the test found the hole that made the fence worth having:
`href` was the one page-derived field the walker did not collapse, and an HTML
attribute value may contain a literal newline, so the field that could forge
the fence was the field nobody had thought of as text.

**The agent-actions pane had no source on this engine, 2026-08-08.** Found by
someone running an agent in an `h5i-light` box and noticing the pane stayed
empty while the agent worked. It was empty *by construction*: the pane is fed by
`browser-actions.jsonl`, which the mediator writes, and
`engage_browser_mediation` returns `None` for any engine agent-browser cannot
drive. Before the resident session that was harmless: there were no verbs to
miss. Adding verbs made it a monitoring surface that silently under-reported,
which is the failure this codebase keeps writing tests against.

`serve` now writes its own action log (`$H5I_BROWSER_ACTIONS`), ingested as a
fourth source into `BoxStream::poll` and rendered **box-claimed**, not
host-observed. That distinction is the point rather than a caveat: h5i sits on
no socket between an agent and this engine because the engine *is* the browser,
and a row claiming otherwise would launder the box's own account into evidence
h5i gathered. The pane note is engine-aware for the same reason. Each verb is
recorded before it runs and again after (no record, no action), which is a
guarantee against accident, not against a box that has decided to lie.

Measured before shipping, because it sits on the verb path: **7µs per verb**
against **42ms** for the single frame encode a scroll triggers when a viewer is
attached. 0.017% of one frame.

**§11 items 5.2a and 5.5 built, 2026-08-08.** Typing, form submission and a
cookie jar, shipped together because separately none of them reaches a login.
Verified end to end against a real login site: type into two fields, submit a
POST, follow the 303, hold the session cookie, and come back to `welcome alice`
on a later navigate.

Blitz owns the form submission algorithm and dispatches to a navigation
provider, so the engine hands it one that *captures* the request rather than
performing it: the encoding is upstream's, the wire stays ours, and a
submission is policy-checked and receipted like everything else. `Broker::send`
generalises `fetch` rather than sitting beside it, because every guarantee lives
in that loop and a POST that took a shortcut would be the one request with no
receipt.

The cookie jar is deliberately narrower than a browser's, and §12's LOGIN-mode warning
is why the narrowings arrived with it rather than after:

- **Host-only.** `Domain` is ignored. Honouring it correctly needs a public
  suffix list; without one, `evil.co.uk` can set a cookie for `co.uk`. The cost
  is that cross-subdomain logins do not persist. That is a missing feature;
  sending a session cookie to the wrong origin would be a vulnerability.
- **In memory only**, so restarting the session is a complete logout.
- **Never readable by the agent**: no verb returns a value, `status` reports a
  count, and the request log records how many cookies crossed rather than which.
  A credential in a receipt is a credential in every export it reaches.
- `Secure` and the `__Secure-`/`__Host-` prefixes enforced, and a redirected
  POST downgraded to a bodyless GET on 301/302/303 so a password is not replayed
  to whatever a server names next.

Two bugs the tests caught rather than review. The request-path matcher used
RFC 6265's *default-path* derivation, which exists only to fill in a missing
`Path` attribute, so a cookie set at `Path=/admin` was never sent to `/admin`.
And `scroll_height` was tried for the scroll range before the fix above: taffy
measures overflow *within* a box, which is zero for an unstyled page whose root
simply grew.

#### Still open, and one correction

**LOGIN mode is not built**, and it is the one item this entry was
warned about: §12 pairs LOGIN mode with cookies precisely because a session
with cookies is the first version of this browser where a stolen credential is
worth having. Until it lands, a human taking over to type a password does so on
a page the agent can still snapshot. File uploads are dropped rather than read,
which is a deliberate refusal to acquire filesystem reach. Tier 3 (policy-gated
script) is now in scope, and the cost of putting it there is §12.5.

**Corrected 2026-08-08.** This entry also said "nothing wires h5i to this
engine yet: M9's `--engine` knob does not exist, so using it in a box is
still manual", which was true the day tier 2 shipped and stopped being true
three commits later on the same branch. `--engine h5i-light`, or
`[profile.X] engine`, pins the engine in `policy.resolved.toml` and so in the
digest; `browser_env` hands that engine `H5I_BROWSER_ALLOW` (the box's own
`net.egress`, loopback included) and `H5I_BROWSER_RECEIPTS` pointing at the
box's spool, and skips the agent-browser shim, whose job is to launch Chrome
and attach a driver, neither of which applies to an engine h5i runs itself.
Using this engine in a box is a create-time flag. The entry is left standing
rather than edited away because the gap it records is the real lesson: a
milestone's "still open" list ages against the commits that follow it.

The original entry follows.

**M10 (as proposed).** The h5i-native engine of 7.1 step 3. With M8's Fetch lane already delivering best-effort
request receipts on Chromium, the engine's case is what mediation cannot
give: fail-closed logging (no running log, no request), script off by
default and checked by policy before evaluation, and the single-use
form-submission capability with structural provenance.

The shape is a **standalone binary**, a workspace crate with its own bin,
not a library h5i links. h5i launches it as a process, hands it the egress
proxy endpoint and a receipts channel, and the engine answers with a
capability manifest (`javascript`, `screenshot`, `video: false`, ...) so h5i
never guesses at what is unimplemented. It speaks the CDP subset the M9 knob
defines, automation plus the screencast domain, so it plugs into the
existing driver, the M8 mediation and the whole viewer stack with no new
plumbing, and fail-closed becomes a protocol property: no receipts channel,
no fetch. This is the agent-browser pattern applied to our own
component (a pinned binary behind a protocol boundary, section 7), and it
prices the risk correctly: if the engine fails, h5i is untouched; if it
succeeds, it can stand as a product of its own. One honesty requirement
travels with the standalone story: bare on a host, outside a box, it is
just a light browser, and its containment claims are made only where the
proxy and the receipt store exist.

The build is **tiered**, each tier shipping value on its own so the hardest
one can slip without taking the milestone with it:

1. **Static render.** Blitz and Stylo parse and lay out, `captureScreenshot`
   and the snapshot verbs work, no JS. Docs-grade reading with full receipts
   is already useful and already demo-able here.
2. **Live view.** The screencast domain with adaptive frames: zero at rest, a
   frame on mutation, 20-30 fps under animation, latest-frame-wins with
   `screencastFrameAck` as the backpressure. The light engine's viewer is
   read-only, and that is not a walk-back of 5.4: the control lock and human
   takeover stay on the Chromium path, which is where login walls route
   anyway (7.1).
3. **Script, policy-gated.** Boa, with the event loop owned by the host
   process (network completions, timers, microtasks, rAF, then
   style/layout/paint, then the frame), and `fetch` registered as a host
   function so a page script never holds a socket: every request goes policy
   check, receipt append, then the wire. Off by default; the grant is a
   profile line pinned in the digest, and the capability manifest reports
   `javascript: false` while it is absent. The cost lives in the web
   bindings (DOM, events, timers, observers), not in Boa, and Test262
   conformance says nothing about the web platform, which is why this tier
   is last.

Exit criteria are numbers, not adjectives: less memory than headless
Chromium on the same page, both at rest and while screencasting; roughly
100ms from action to updated frame locally; rest-state CPU near zero.
"Rust, therefore light" is a hypothesis until measured.

Gated on two things: M9's findings say a light engine is actually usable for
the reading half of the loop, and Kitesurf's open-source release has landed so
the build-versus-adopt call is made with the code on the table, not the blog
post.

### M11. The developer-mode viewer: built, 2026-08-07

`d` in the terminal viewer splits the screen: the page keeps the top, and a
console/error pane takes the bottom third. What it shows was already arriving
and being thrown away. `ConsoleError` and `PageError` carried their text and the
viewer kept only a counter. Page text is passed through `sanitize_display`
before it is drawn, because a console message is untrusted input and would
otherwise repaint the viewer's own chrome.

The layout and the pane renderer are pure functions (`termview/panes.rs`) with
the split, the truncation, the bounded buffer and the sanitising all tested.
`App` stays the thin thing that positions and writes, which is why any of it is
testable at all. A terminal shorter than 16 rows keeps the whole page rather
than showing two useless slivers.

Not built: a per-request network pane. Nothing on the viewer's stream carries
requests, and the mediator's records are host-side, so that needs a source
rather than a layout.

**M11 (as proposed).** The terminal
viewer's default becomes a developer view rather than a page view: for a
coding agent's overseer, the rendered page alone is the least informative
pane. Something like

```
┌───────── page ──────────┬────── snapshot ───────┐
│    rendered frames      │ e12 button "Submit"   │
│                         │ e13 textbox "Email"   │
├──────── console ────────┼────── network ────────┤
│ TypeError at App.tsx:42 │ 200 GET  /api/user    │
│                         │ 500 POST /api/save    │
├─────────────────── actions ─────────────────────┤
│ click @e12 · fill @e13 "a@b.c" · snapshot       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The composition is cheap because every pane's source exists or arrives with
M8: termview already decodes frames (5.10), the drain already collects
console and network errors, and the mediated socket plus the Fetch lane turn
per-action and per-request evidence into live streams instead of a post-run
artifact. Input keeps the lock's semantics untouched: watching is the
default, `i` still takes control, and the takeover is how a login wall gets
answered (7.1). This is also the demo surface the open item 2 candidate
wants: the receipts, watched live.

Full loop the demo has to show:

```
agent edits code -> starts dev server -> opens the app with h5i browser
  -> reads the accessibility tree -> clicks and fills -> reads console and
  network errors -> screenshots -> fixes the code -> human watches or takes over
  -> export patch, report, screenshots, receipt
```

### M11a. The browser terminal: the event model and the evidence panes, built 2026-08-08

The half this entry called durable, and said would land
first, has: `browser_events` is the one stream, and the console reads it.

* **The model** (`crates/h5i-core/src/browser_events.rs`). Every event carries
  its lane *and* its grade, kept apart because they answer different questions
  and the interesting case needs both: our own engine's request log is
  **box-claimed** (written inside the box) and **fail-closed** (the engine will
  not fetch what it cannot record). Chromium's Fetch lane is box-claimed and
  best-effort. One "trusted" flag could not have said that. `caused_by` is set
  only where the source carries the link (a response to its request by
  sequence number, a refusal to the action that provoked it) and nowhere else,
  so no arrow on the screen is drawn from two things merely having happened at
  about the same time. Ingest sanitises every box string once, here, rather than
  in each renderer, because M11b writes this same text straight to a PTY.
* **Three real sources**, no placeholders: the light engine's request log, the
  mediator's actions, and the drained page evidence.
* **The mediator now writes its actions as data.** They were only ever on the
  receipt as *rendered text*, so a reader wanting them back would have had to
  parse a display format, the quiet-wrong-answer shape this file keeps
  recording. `browser-actions.jsonl` sits beside `receipt.jsonl`, host-side,
  where the box cannot write, and the round trip is pinned by a test.
* **In `h5i ui`, on the console's own terms.** One `GET`, the same token gate,
  no second web surface. Every row shows its lane and grade as words rather than
  as a colour, selecting a row lights what it caused and what caused it, the
  network pane names its engine's evidence grade in its header, and a dropped
  count is rendered rather than hidden.

#### Driven against a real box

**Not only a test client**, which is the gap M10 recorded and
this milestone was gated on not repeating. The real engine opened a page with
two refused subresources, wrote its own log into the box's `/tmp`, and the
console served the stream: both denials as `box-claimed` / `fail-closed`, each
with a `policy-verdict` naming the request that caused it; the cursor returning
only the tail on the next poll; an unauthenticated request refused with 401. Two
guards checked by making them fail: a Chromium box with that same log planted in
its `/tmp` yields **nothing**, because only our engine's log may wear the
fail-closed grade, and the mediator's sidecar shows up `host-observed` on the
box that has one.

**The finding, which cost the first live attempt.** `ResolvedPolicy::home_binds`
is `#[serde(skip)]`, so `host_tmp_root`, correct for a live run and the
only caller it had, returns `None` for **every** policy loaded back from disk.
The console asked a live-run question of a stored policy and got a silently
empty stream for a session that had one: enforcement-shaped code answering
"nothing to show" instead of "I cannot tell". The reader now takes the path from
`private_tmp_backing`, the same function that placed it.

#### Second pass, same day: its own tab, and the reader made honest

* **The stream is incremental and session-aware, which was a bug fix rather
  than an optimisation.** The first reader re-parsed every source per poll and
  numbered from 1 each time: stable only while files grow by appending, and
  they do not: every run clears the box's private `/tmp`, so a second browser
  run restarts the request log at zero bytes and restarts the numbering with
  it. A console tab open across two runs would have kept its cursor and
  silently dropped the head of the new session. The console now holds a byte
  offset per source, notices a file that got *shorter*, and emits
  `session-reset` as a visible row; ids never restart. Pinned by five tests
  driven against real files, including the partial-line and vanished-file
  cases, and confirmed live: with a viewer holding a stale cursor, a second run
  produced the reset row and then the new session's events, where before it
  produced nothing.
* **A per-box Browser tab.** Evidence is a scroll of what happened; the browser
  terminal is a live instrument, and wedging it between Services and the
  timeline gave it a few hundred pixels. It now takes the pane. The tab appears
  only for a browser box, and selecting another box returns to Evidence rather
  than showing a browser view of something that has no browser.
* **A page pane that says what it cannot show.** It reports whether a live view
  is running in the box (the same `.stream` discovery `h5i box view` uses) and
  names the command to attach, because the console watches and the *forward*
  carries pixels and input with the control lock on it. For an `h5i-light` box
  it states the engine-level caveat plainly: that engine has no resident
  session, so each `open` renders its own page and exits, and a live view shows
  **that** process's page rather than the one the agent is driving. An
  unlabelled viewport there would have been the most convincing wrong answer on
  the screen.

One bug this pass created and caught before it shipped, worth recording because
it is the same shape twice: the new `session-reset` event was added server-side
while the console's own union type and pane router still knew six kinds, so the
row was dropped silently in the browser, the swallow that had just been fixed
one layer down, moved one layer up. Found by grepping the *served bundle* for
the divider text rather than by trusting a green typecheck, which could not see
it: an unknown variant simply matched no case.

#### Third pass: the console carries pixels

The page pane shows the box's page,
rendered by our own engine inside the box. The frame lane is joined, and the way
it is joined is the point:

* **A reader, not a proxy.** A background thread per watched box enters the
  box's user and network namespaces by pid, connects to the stream server, and
  reads, the same route `h5i box view --term` takes (`view::connect_in_netns`),
  reusing the same hardened WebSocket client (`termview::ws`, which refuses
  reserved opcodes, masked server frames and oversized lengths). Nothing new
  listens; the box gains no reachability it did not have.
* **The console's structural guarantee survives.** Every route is still a `GET`,
  because the frame is served *as* a `GET` returning `image/jpeg`, with `nosniff` so
  crafted bytes cannot be re-read as anything else, `no-store` so a frame of
  somebody's page does not settle into a disk cache. And the relay is
  one-directional by construction: the only messages it can send upstream are
  `config` and `ack`, there is no path from an HTTP request to a write on that
  socket, and a test greps this module for `input_*` so the day someone adds one
  the build says so. Typing into a page still has exactly one door: the forward,
  which enforces the control lock.
* **Change-driven, end to end.** The stream reports the newest frame's sequence
  number and the page keys its `<img>` on it, so an unchanged page is zero
  requests rather than a timer redrawing a still picture, the engine's own rule,
  carried up to the browser.
* **The picture is labelled.** A frame is **box-claimed**: the box's rendering of
  its own page. Nothing derived from it reaches the trusted status row, and the
  `h5i-light` caveat sits under the image rather than being left for a reader to
  infer: that engine has no resident session, so a served view shows the page
  the *serving* process opened, which need not be the one the agent is driving.

Driven end to end rather than asserted: the engine served a page inside a
supervised box, the console found the `.stream`, crossed the namespace, and
returned a 1280×720 JPEG at `frame_seq 2` with the right headers; stopping the
in-box server flipped `live_view` to false, dropped the relay, and the frame
route went to 204. One test was rewritten on the way: clippy caught it
comparing two constants, which is a tautology that would have passed with the
size check deleted; it now drives the real decoder with real base64.

#### Still open, and none of it is dressing

The
accessibility snapshot has no live source (it is a CLI verb today). Takeover is
not wired here: the console remains read-only and input still goes through
`h5i box view`, so the read-only-by-default / interact-under-the-lock rule below
is *stated* by this milestone and *enforced* by the forward, which is one
surface short of the exit criterion. Nothing links an agent action to the
requests it caused, since neither the mediator's records nor the engine's log carries
the other's id, so "selecting an action surfaces its correlated request" holds
only for the verdict it provoked, and closing it is a change at the *sources*,
not in the viewer. M11b has not started, so the claim that two readers agree is
untested. The original entry follows.

**M11a (as proposed).** M11 put
the developer view in the terminal; this puts the full one where it can
actually breathe, inside `h5i ui`. The design motif is a trading terminal.
Hyperliquid is the reference, the way terminal-browser was for 5.10: what we
take is the information model (peer panes of equal rank, change-driven row
highlights, an always-on status bar), not the skin. The reasoning is the same
one M11 recorded: for an agent's overseer the rendered page is the *least*
informative pane, so page viewport, accessibility snapshot, agent actions,
network requests, console, and policy verdicts sit side by side at equal rank:
what the agent saw, what it did, what moved on the wire, and what h5i
refused, in one view.

**One web surface, not a second one.** This lives in the existing console:
same axum server, same embedded bundle, same `web` feature, same loopback
bind. The console's own rule, every route is a GET, stands; the live data
and the input direction ride the per-box forward that already exists (5.9),
with its per-box token and its lock check on input. The console gains a view,
not a write path.

**Not a read-only browser.** The viewer is read-only by default, interactive
only while holding the control lock (5.4), and taking the lock is itself a
recorded policy event: the takeover and the window in which human input
flowed belong in the receipt next to the verbs the mediator refused during
it. This is the terminal viewer's VIEW/INTERACT model (5.10) given a second
skin, not a new input policy; a viewer that could never take over would
delete M5's takeover story, and one that could always type would delete the
lock.

**The durable half is the event model, and it lands first.** One stream from
the browser runtime (frames, snapshots, actions, requests, console, policy
verdicts, metrics), with every event stamped with its session, ordinal,
timestamp, kind, a `caused_by` back-reference, and its **lane**:
host-observed or box-claimed, the same two kinds of claim the receipt
already keeps apart. The web view, the terminal view, and the exported
receipt all read this one stream, which is what makes the viewer a live
receipt rather than a dashboard that happens to resemble one: selecting an
action shows the request, console output, and verdict that carry its id.
The panes inherit the honesty rules with the data: the status bar shows
host-derived values only (box-claimed metrics are labeled, not promoted),
and the network pane names its evidence grade per engine: h5i-light's
fail-closed request log is authoritative, the Chromium path's Fetch lane is
best-effort, and a pane that showed both alike would read as enforcement
where there is none. Update budgets are per pane, not global: the viewport
is change-driven (the light engine idles at zero frames by design; ~30fps
is a Chromium screencast ceiling, not a target), status ticks slowly, rows
batch, histories are bounded rings.

The host browser trusts this page with nothing new: it renders pixels and
structured events, target HTML never enters the viewer's DOM, box strings
render as text (`sanitize_display`'s rule, applied in a second place), and
the CSP names no external origin.

Exit criteria: the console shows a live box with every pane labeled by lane;
selecting an action surfaces its correlated request, console output, and
verdict; a takeover started from the viewer types into the page and lands in
the receipt as a policy event alongside the agent verbs refused during it;
the network pane states its evidence grade per engine; and the TUI showing
the same session shows the same events, because divergence between the two
viewers is a bug in the model, not a difference of skin.

Gated on the shared event stream existing (this milestone's own first half)
and on M10's open item being closed first, the live view driven by a real
`h5i box view` against a real box, because a polished terminal over a
stream never exercised end to end inverts this file's own priorities.

### M11b. Terminal watch mode: proposed, 2026-08-08

The shipped terminal
viewer (5.10, M7, M11) re-pointed at the same event stream and kept,
deliberately smaller: viewport, trusted status row, latest actions, console
errors, denied requests, panes cycled rather than tiled. It is the SSH and
demo surface ("or stay entirely inside the terminal"), and it does not
chase pane parity with M11a: the investment moves to the web view, and the
TUI's job is to watch, take the lock when a login wall demands it, and prove
the event model has two independent readers. Nothing shipped is discarded.

### M11c. Two audit surfaces: a decision stream, and the page beside its cost. Proposed, 2026-08-19

M11a built the event model and the console's evidence panes; M11b keeps a
smaller terminal viewer over the same stream. Both are surfaces for **watching a
box**. This entry adds the two that are missing, and they are missing in
different directions: one is for the person running the box, the other is for
the person reading the page.

The framing that produced both: **a log is not an answer.** `receipt.jsonl` with
two thousand rows is evidence and nobody reads it. The questions a human
actually arrives with are few — did anything leave, was anything refused, what
did the agent read before it wrote this, is this record real — and an audit
surface should be shaped like those questions rather than like the storage.
Only the first two are in this milestone.

#### 1. `h5i box watch`: one line per decision

A non-interactive stream of policy decisions as they are made. Not a viewer:
no viewport, no panes, no cycling, no lock. It is the `tail -f` of the receipt
and it is meant to be piped, grepped and left running in a second pane.

```
$ h5i box watch mybox
14:02:11  net      ALLOW  GET   https://docs.rs/blitz/0.3.0/  (12 KB, 84ms)
14:02:11  net      DENY   GET   https://telemetry.example.com/collect
                                 net.egress does not list this host; nothing left
14:02:12  browser  click  @e3 "Sign in"
14:02:12  net      ALLOW  POST  https://app.local/login  (cookies: 1)
14:02:13  exec     cargo test
```

**This is distinct from M11b and does not replace it.** M11b is a pane-based
TUI with a viewport, which is a thing you sit in front of. This is a line
stream, which is a thing you leave running. The distinction is worth keeping
because the reason to build it is behavioural rather than technical: trust in a
sandbox is built by watching it once, seeing it behave, and then stopping. A
surface that must be opened and attended to is a surface that is not used after
the first week, and `--deny-only` is the form that can be left on forever.

Requirements that follow from the rest of this file:

* **Third reader of one stream.** M11a's whole point is that `browser_events`
  is the single stream; M11b was gated on proving it had two independent
  readers. This is the third, and it must consume the same model, including
  `lane` and `grade` as words. A row whose grade is `box-claimed` says so here
  too; the terse format is not licence to drop the qualifier that makes the row
  honest.
* **Sanitised once, at ingest.** Already true (M11a), and load-bearing here
  because this writes box-supplied strings straight to a terminal, exactly as
  M11b does.
* **Refusals are the headline.** `--deny-only` is the flag; a run that refused
  nothing should be able to say that in one line rather than in silence.
* **`--json` is the record, the default is the answer.** The same split the
  session verbs use.

#### 2. The page beside what it cost

The console draws a network pane and a viewport. It does not draw them
*together*, and for this engine that is the picture no other browser can
produce: the rendered page, and directly beneath it every request that was made
to render it, each with its verdict. "What did looking at this page cost, and
what was refused while I looked" is one glance rather than two panes and a
correlation done by eye. `caused_by` (M11a) already carries the links needed to
draw it.

Second, and smaller to build than to decide: **draw the fence.** The snapshot
wraps page content in `--- BEGIN/END UNTRUSTED PAGE CONTENT ---` (§12.1) because
that is the moment attacker-controlled text reaches something deciding what to
do next. The console currently renders page-derived text without that boundary
being visible, so the human reader is given *less* framing than the model is.
Rendering the same fence in the UI costs almost nothing and removes an
asymmetry that is hard to defend once noticed.

Neither of these is a new evidence source. Both are M11a's stream, arranged so
the arrangement itself carries the argument.

#### What was considered and rejected: putting receipts in git

The tempting version of "make the evidence live where review already happens"
is a receipt digest in a commit trailer, or the bundle summary in
`git notes --ref=h5i`. It is cheap, it survives forever, and it appears in the
pull request without anyone opening a tool.

**Refuse it.** Two reasons, and the second is the one that settles it:

1. It is a second export path that does not pass the export gate. §5.6's
   redaction and size caps apply to `h5i box export`; a note written beside it
   inherits none of that, and receipts carry URLs, hostnames and query strings
   that are exactly where a token ends up.
2. **It is unretractable.** A note or trailer that has been pushed is on every
   clone and in every fork, and a force-push does not recall it. Every other
   evidence path in this design is a local artifact that a person chooses to
   hand over. This one publishes by default, and "the agent's record leaked the
   credential the agent was careful with" is a failure this project should not
   be able to have.

Recorded here so it is refused in review rather than re-argued. If the pull
request really is the right place for this, the thing to put there is a
reference to a bundle, produced by the gate, that someone chose to share.

#### Order, and what this does not include

`h5i box watch` first: it is small, it consumes a stream that already exists,
and it is the surface that makes the guarantee visible day to day. The paired
view second. The fence line can land with either.

Deliberately **not** in this milestone, and both larger than it:

* **`h5i box why <name>`**, a provenance query rather than a log reader
  (`--reached <host>`, `--wrote <path>`). The interesting one, and the one that
  has to be honest about a hard limit: what the receipt holds is *temporal
  co-occurrence*, not causation. "The agent read these pages before it wrote
  this file" is true and useful; "these pages caused this file" is not
  something the record supports. It is buildable only if it says which of the
  two it is, in the output, every time. Left out until that wording is settled,
  because the failure mode of getting it wrong is this project's worst one.
* **`h5i verify <bundle>`**, the third-party check, which needs §B11.5.16's
  signed receipt before it means anything. Its UX shape is a one-line verdict
  followed by an explicit statement of what the record does **not** cover, which
  is the same instinct as `capabilities` (§12) and `unsupported()` (§B8.4)
  applied to the audit trail. That paragraph is the differentiating part of the
  feature, not a caveat attached to it.

### M12. Share: built, 2026-08-10 (5.11, 5.11.1)

The bridge first, because it
is the part both transports share and the part that touches the boundary:
netns dial-in, the grant table with mint / verify / expire / revoke, the HTTP
gate, and the ingress receipt lane. Then iroh and `h5i join`. Then the quick
tunnel on the same bridge. Viewer sharing was explicitly not in this milestone
and is not built.

#### What was verified, and how

**What is demonstrated, and by what.** The suite covers the whole P2P chain
end to end in-process (QUIC handshake, greeting, grant table, the dialer's fd
handoff, the byte pump) with a wrong ticket refused on the same connection and
a revoke written by another process stopping the next one. The tunnel front is
driven exactly as `cloudflared` drives it, including against a dev server
written to ignore `Connection: close`, which is what pins the one-request rule.
The gate's promise that the share credential never reaches the box is pinned by
reading the rewritten head.

**Run for real on 2026-08-10, and this is the part that was open.** A live
`supervised` box with a dev server inside it, shared over iroh, joined from a
second `h5i` process, and fetched with `curl`:

- the invite bounced to a cookie (`h5i_share_40959`, port-scoped as designed)
  and the box's HTML came back through the joiner's loopback proxy;
- the path was **direct**, hole punching rather than a relay, with the endpoint's
  real addresses in the ticket;
- a request with no cookie and one with a wrong cookie both got `401`, and
  neither reached the box;
- `h5i box share revoke` from a third process cut the peer off; the joiner
  printed the sharer's own close reason rather than a transport error;
- the export's receipt named the peer, the grant and its label, the window, the
  connection count, the byte counts and the path:
  `08e03775419e… via direct — grant 38bd63e2 (reviewer), 14s, 1 connection,
  97 in / 412 out`. The connection count is *one*, because the redirect and
  both refusals were answered by the joiner's own proxy and never crossed,
  which is the gate working, visible in the evidence.

**Re-run on 2026-08-10 after the third round of fixes**, because that round
rewrote the response path: seven sequential requests each on their own
connection (the receipt says so), `Connection: close` in every answer, and a
`HEAD` returning in five milliseconds where the version before it would have
waited three hundred seconds for a body that a `HEAD` never has.

**The tunnel, run for real on 2026-08-10.** `cloudflared` was installed and a
quick tunnel carried live traffic over the internet: the invite link bounced
into a `Secure` cookie, `GET`, `HEAD` and a 300 KB `POST` all came back from the
box, an anonymous request and one with a wrong token both got `401`, and the
receipt named the transport, the grant, six connections, 678 KB in and 676 KB
out, one refusal, and the "not end-to-end encrypted" note.

Two things the live run found that no test would have. A `POST` answered `501`
and the first diagnosis, that `cloudflared` chunks every body and the proxy
refused chunked, was **wrong**: the `501` came from the box's own
`python -m http.server`, which has no `do_POST`. (Chunked request bodies are
forwarded now rather than refused, which is a real improvement and was reachable
from a direct client; it was not what that `501` was.) And killing the box's
session left the share answering `502` forever with nothing said, because the
dialer's helper lives *inside* the box's network namespace and keeps it alive
after everything else in it has gone, so a box restarted afterwards gets a new
namespace the share can never reach. The share now notices and ends.

**The whole response matrix, run over both transports on 2026-08-10.** A dev
server in a box answering a page, a `304`, a `HEAD`, a chunked response, a form
`POST`, a chunked `POST` and an `Expect: 100-continue` upload, every shape the
framing code had to be rewritten twice to get right, with an anonymous request
refused alongside them. All of it in single-digit milliseconds on the P2P path.
The two receipts record seven and six connections, which is one per request,
which is the one-request rule visible in the evidence.

**Hot reload, run for real on 2026-08-10, over both transports.** A dev server
in a box answering a `Sec-WebSocket-Key` handshake with a genuine `101`, driven
from a client that speaks the frame format: `echo:reload-please` came back
through a Cloudflare quick tunnel, and again over a direct P2P path. Both
receipts record it as two connections, which is what a page plus a socket is.

**Two peers and a per-person revoke, run for real on 2026-08-10.** A tunnel
share with two grants: both admitted, `share revoke` on one, and the other kept
working: `200` and `401` from the same URL a second apart. The receipt lists
them separately by grant and label, with the revoked one's traffic still counted
and the refusal recorded as revoked rather than unknown. That is the property
the whole grant model exists for and it had never been exercised outside a test.

Also verified live, and worth recording because it was a defect this branch
introduced and fixed: two `h5i join` sessions on one machine, a browser holding
both of their cookies, and the box seeing neither, only the app's own `sid=9`.

#### The review rounds, and what each lens found

**Rounds 8 to 10, and what live running kept finding.** A ticket expiring on
its own, neither revoked nor interrupted, ends the share, writes the receipt,
clears the record, and now tells the joiner why; that path was verified twice
because the first fix for it was inert. A dev server that rejects a request
before reading its body has its own answer relayed rather than replaced. And a
`--tunnel` share with two grants had one of them revoked while the other kept
working.

**Rounds 11 to 14, and the two that would have bitten a real user.** A client
that sends its request and then shuts down its write side, which is legal HTTP/1.1 and
what anything built out of one write and one read does, had that EOF read as
"the visitor left", so the relay stopped on the spot: a 2 MB download arrived as
63 bytes, with a clean close and nothing recorded anywhere. And `h5i join` was
hung up on by the sharer thirty seconds after connecting, because the sharer
drops a connection that has never authorized a stream and the joiner did not
open one until somebody visited the page, so the ordinary sequence (send a
ticket, they join, *then* they open the browser) killed itself. The joiner now
presents its ticket once at connect time, which fixes that and makes "joined" a
statement about the ticket rather than about the network: a revoked ticket fails
at `join` instead of at the first page load.

The same rounds found `share status` rendering every share as `0m left` for its
final minute, one column away from `expired`; `share grant` racing `share stop`
closely enough to bring a stopped share back to life; a `revoke` on a crashed
share reporting that connections had been dropped; a reused pid producing a
share that could be neither stopped nor restarted by any verb; and Ctrl-C being
swallowed for the whole six-second teardown on three of the four ways a share
ends.

**Round 15, and the fix that was worse than the bug.** Making Ctrl-C responsive
during the teardown was done by arming the hard-exit watcher after the select.
On the three exits where no signal had been delivered yet, that meant the
operator's *first* Ctrl-C hit a watcher built for their second: it printed
"interrupted again", threw the receipt away and exited. Pressing Ctrl-C once to
get a prompt back destroyed the one artifact this feature exists to produce, and
said they had done it twice. An interrupt during the ending now means "stop
waiting", not "stop recording"; only a second one exits without a receipt.
Verified live three times out of three.

The same round found that the join-time ticket check, itself a fix from the
previous round, went the whole way into the box, costing a connection to the
dev server and one of the share's 64 slots per join; that a new joiner against
an un-updated sharer would be told its ticket was revoked, forever, because the
greeting changed without the ALPN changing; and that `clear`, `clear_now` and
`forget` deleted whatever record was on disk without checking whose it was,
which a `stop --force` followed by a fresh `share` turns into one process
deleting another's grant table after its ticket has been given to a human.

**Round 16 was a fuzzer rather than a reader**, on the argument that fifteen
rounds of adversarial reading had started mostly finding the previous round's
work. `crates/h5i-share/src/fuzz.rs` generates request and response heads from a
grammar seeded with every awkward token the earlier rounds turned up, mutates
them, and asserts the properties the rest of the crate is entitled to assume:
the credential never reaches the box, a redirect never leaves the origin, one
framing and one `Connection` on the way out, line discipline in both
directions. It is deterministic, prints the seed for any failure, and
`H5I_FUZZ_ROUNDS` turns it into a soak.

Twenty million heads found two defects a person had not: `split_cookie` applied
its "nothing named like ours goes upstream" rule on the branch where a cookie
has an `=` and not on the branch where it does not, and a response head with no
status line at all was relayed with a *header* promoted into the status line's
place, which a browser reports as a protocol error and nobody can trace. Two of
the four failures it reported were the invariants being wrong rather than the
code, which is its own kind of useful: `007` is a legal `Content-Length` and a
cookie named `999h5i_share` is somebody else's.

**Rounds 16 to 26 changed the kind of reader**, on the argument that fifteen
rounds of adversarial reading had started mostly finding the previous round's
work. A fuzzer, an end-to-end script that automates the live checks that had
been done by hand for five rounds, a leak hunt, a flake hunt, the two capacity
ceilings nothing had ever driven, an accounting sweep of every counter, and,
the one that found most, a review from the **joiner's** side, asking what a
hostile *sharer* can do to the person who pasted their ticket.

That last direction had never been examined. It found that the joiner's
handshake had no deadline on any of its three steps, so a sharer who simply
never answered left `h5i join` hung with nothing printed at all; that a page
served on the joiner's loopback could register a service worker, which outlives
the share and keeps control of that address afterwards; that a ticket's
addressing went to iroh unexamined, so one naming `127.0.0.1:2375` made the
joiner dial a service on its own machine; and that the QUIC close reason, which
the sharer chooses, was printed to the joiner's terminal unsanitised, the same
escape-injection the `box_id` fix had just closed, through the field next to it.

The fuzzer needed a round of its own, too. Measured against the real parser,
1.9% of its heads were parseable, **none** of two million carried both framings,
and about one per run carried a credential, so "twenty million heads pass" was
true and meant almost nothing. Sampling the line ending once per head rather
than once per line, and leaving two thirds of heads unmutated, took those to
18%, 0.8% and 0.8%; the test now asserts floors on all three, so a generator
that stops reaching the code fails instead of passing.

**Rounds 27 to 36** kept changing the lens. Two more directions had never been
looked at, and both paid: a review from the **joiner's** side (what a hostile
*sharer* can do to the person who pasted the ticket) and one of **how a live
share interacts with the rest of h5i**: the lifecycle verbs, the export, the
console, and the fact that a share holds a box's namespace open.

The worst thing either found: **a share of a box at the `process` tier with a
profile that denies egress can never work, and the docs recommended exactly
that configuration.** Such a box gets a network namespace of its own with no
loopback brought up in it, so nothing inside can reach even itself. The share
started, printed a ticket, and left both people reading messages about a dev
server that was running the whole time. It is refused now, by name, and the
MANUAL and the skill no longer name that tier as an option.

Second: **a share pins one namespace at startup and only asked whether the box
had *any* session.** Every session gets a new namespace, so somebody who exits
a shell and starts another, or who has a read-only observer attached while
they restart, left the share serving a namespace nothing was in, with
`share ls` reporting it healthy. It compares the namespace now.

Third, and the same argument for the third time: the wire had four reply codes
and no way to say "h5i cannot reach the box". The receipt learned to tell that
apart from "your dev server is down" in round 19; the joiner's browser was
still being told to go and ask the sharer to start a server that was running.

**The three findings rounds 27-36 recorded and did not fix** are fixed now, and
each was verified by reproducing it first.

`cloudflared` outlived a `SIGKILL` of the share by more than twenty seconds,
with its public `trycloudflare.com` hostname still registered and still
pointing at a loopback port that had just been freed, so for that window
anything on the machine that bound it was on the public internet under a
hostname h5i minted. `kill_on_drop` is a destructor and `SIGKILL` skips
destructors; `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` is the kernel doing it instead. Measured: gone
in one second, against twenty-plus with the change removed.

macOS carried that hazard in full until it was closed the only way Darwin
allows. `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` is something a process asks *for itself*, so Linux
sets it in the child between fork and exec; nothing can ask it on behalf of a
binary h5i does not compile. So a watchdog process waits on `kqueue` for either
the share or `cloudflared` to exit, and kills the tunnel if the share went
first, a separate process precisely because a `SIGKILL` cannot skip what is
not running the share's code. Both pids are watched, not just the share's: a
watchdog armed on one pid alone would outlive the tunnel it was guarding and
eventually `SIGKILL` whatever inherited the recycled number. Measured on macOS
the same way: the public hostname survived the full ten-second observation
window before, and the tunnel is gone within 250 ms after.

`h5i box rm` did not know what a share was. A shared box is almost always also
`running`, so the operator was told to abort the box and never that somebody
outside was connected to it, and the check has to sit *above* the status guard
or it is unreachable. Worse, a share that outlived the removal wrote its
receipt afterwards, and `receipt::append` creates the directory it writes into:
the box came back as a receipt log and a payload under a path with no manifest,
which every tool answers "no environment named that" for and only `rm -rf`
clears. The receipt is skipped when the box is gone, which loses it. The right
trade, since it is evidence about something that no longer exists.

And the console showed nothing at all while a box was open to somebody. The
receipt lands when the share *ends*, so the one lane that lets somebody **in**
was the one lane the console could not see while it was open. `shared_now` is
on the box row now.

The pattern across all fifteen rounds is worth recording, because it is the
argument for having run them: **every round found real defects in the previous
round's fixes**, and five of the sharpest were fixes that did nothing at all: a
`Connection: close` the box could ignore, a shutdown signal that was sent after
the shutdown, a flag that recorded truncation for the rarest of the four ways a
response gets cut short, and a linger drain whose two dedicated tests both
passed with it deleted, and a signal handler armed for a second Ctrl-C that
caught the first. That linger drain is now documented as what it is: bounded,
kept for the sake of the intermediary on a tunnel share, and not a thing we can
show changes what a visitor receives on Linux.

`--direct-only` has been run, and it does what it says on the half that can be
run here: the share starts, the peer gets a direct path, traffic flows, and the
receipt records `via direct`.

**macOS now has a route, and it is a different argument rather than the same
one ported.** A Seatbelt box has no namespace to enter and binds the host's
loopback, so "the box's port 3000" and "this machine's port 3000" are one port,
which is why an earlier macOS arm, deleted in round 51, was wrong to connect
to it and call whatever answered the box. What replaces it (`share::owner`)
asks Darwin which process holds the listening socket and shares it only when
that process is in the box's tree; a stranger, or a second process sharing the
address, is refused and named. The check is redone on every dial, so a dev
server that exits cannot have its share inherited by whatever claims the port
next.

That this is not a theoretical hazard was demonstrated by the machine it was
written on: port 3000 was held by the box's `python3 -m http.server` on `::`
*and* by an unrelated `serve.py` on `127.0.0.1`, and a plain loopback connect
reached the stranger. Run end to end on macOS: share, `h5i join`, a direct
QUIC path, and the visitor receiving the box's directory listing rather than
the stranger's page. The three outcomes were each exercised: the box's port
shared, a stranger's port refused by name, and an empty port warned about
rather than refused. Boxes at the `container` and `microvm` tiers on macOS live
inside a VM where no host process holds the port; they are refused with that
reason rather than "nothing is listening".

**Nine review rounds over that route (36–44) found six defects, and the shape
of them is the point.** Only one was in the reasoning; the rest were in what
the code could *see*.

- The pid-identity hardening added for `session_pid` turned `h5i box share`
  **off** on macOS entirely: `proc_start_ticks` read `/proc`, answered `None`
  everywhere else, and the verified reader skips records that cannot prove
  themselves. Both halves were individually correct and tested; no test held
  the three together, and the platform where it broke was the one CI cannot
  run the command on.
- A pid that changed hands between the tree snapshot and the socket scan was
  vouched for by the snapshot. Re-asked upwards from the winner now.
- Both kernel scans sized their buffer once and added fixed slack. The kernel
  never says "there was more", and both lists are ordered, so a process that
  opens descriptors faster than the guess can push its own listening socket off
  the end of the scan, and a listener h5i cannot see is one it cannot refuse.
  Both grow until the answer provably fits.
- The refusal named the offending process, and that name is the executable's
  file name, chosen by whoever started it. A binary named with a literal `ESC`
  wrote escape sequences into the sentence an operator reads while deciding
  whether their port has been taken. Sanitised through the same helper the rest
  of the repository already used.
- A newborn child inherits its parent's descriptors across `fork`, so between
  `fork` and `exec` it really does hold the dev server's listening socket,
  and judged against a snapshot taken microseconds earlier it is a *stranger*
  co-holding the box's address, which is a refusal. A busy box therefore
  refused its own visitors in proportion to how busy it was. Found by a
  concurrency test on its first run, with `/usr/bin/true` reported as
  co-holding a port.
- And the module's own note claimed a refusal it could not make: a listener
  belonging to another user is never *attributed* to the box, which is safe,
  but neither can it be counted as a competitor, so "unambiguous" rested in
  part on not having seen what this process may not see. Recorded as a limit
  rather than argued away.

The through-line: on Linux the namespace makes the guarantee true by
construction, and there is nothing to observe. Here it is established by
observation, and every defect but one was the observation being incomplete,
which is the failure mode this approach has and the namespace does not, and is
worth stating plainly wherever the two are compared.

#### Still not demonstrated

The two h5i processes were on one machine: a real
direct QUIC path through the host's network stack, but not two machines on two
networks. On macOS the two-machine half is likewise untried, and `SO_REUSEPORT`
contention is covered by unit tests over the decision rule rather than by two
real processes racing for one address. And `--direct-only` has never been
exercised against a hole punch that actually *fails*. The refusal is the half
that matters and it needs two hostile NATs to reach. Those are what remains of
the exit criteria.

### M13. The microvm tier, warmed: steps 1 and 2 built 2026-08-13, step 3 proposed

The tier shipped correct and slow: one `msb run` per command, a full guest boot
each time, torn down on drop, and — as 9. said until today — never booted end
to end anywhere. A reading of forkd (deeplethe/forkd, a Firecracker runtime
whose whole premise is fork-from-warm: each child `mmap`s a warmed parent's
snapshot memory copy-on-write and spawns in ~100 ms instead of booting)
sharpened what to do about that into three steps, in order, each gated on the
one before.

**First, demonstrate and measure: done, and it moved the plan.** The tier
boots a real guest — a microvm box creates, runs, enforces its allowlist in
the guest netstack, and exits 0 — so the "not yet demonstrated end to end"
caveat is retired. The numbers are in `docs/benchmarks/microvm-boot.md`,
taken with `scripts/bench_env_overhead.py`, which is committed so they can be
re-derived rather than trusted. What it borrowed from forkd was the
discipline, not a mechanism: every sample kept, the tier that could not run
recorded with the probe's own refusal, and the null results written down.

Three results changed what steps 2 and 3 should be:

- **461 ms of fixed cost per command, and almost none of it is isolation.**
  Subtracting each tier's own no-op cost, the VM's per-syscall charge is
  −7.3 ms — noise around zero — and it does not slow CPU-bound work. The tier
  is not a slow place to work, it is an expensive place to start, which is the
  cost profile that amortises and the reason reuse leads.
- **A third of that tax is the memory cap — and it belongs to step 2, not
  before it.** Adding one h5i behaviour at a time to a bare `msb run` found
  mounts nearly free (+17 ms for the full 16-mount set over a 74 MiB
  `.git/objects`), egress rules free, and the preload script +9 ms — all three
  inside the control's own 230–245 ms run-to-run drift, so read as no
  measurable cost — but the profile's **8 GiB `mem_bytes` costs +154 ms on
  every command**, scaling at roughly 20 ms per GiB.

  This was first written up here as a free win available today. **That was
  wrong, and testing it is what corrected it.** Guest RAM *is* the memory
  limit at this tier, so simply lowering the number trades enforcement
  headroom for latency. The trade can be avoided — `msb` takes a
  `--max-memory` hotplug ceiling independently of `--memory`, and booting
  `512M` with `--max-memory 8G` costs 237 ms against 384 ms — but
  `--max-memory` **does not grow anything by itself** (a 512M/max-8G guest
  fails a 1.5 GiB allocation exactly like a plain 512M one). Growth takes an
  explicit `msb modify --memory`, which works on a live guest in ~9 ms, is
  asynchronous ("converging"), and **keeps the cap honest**: 6 GiB against a
  4 GiB ceiling still fails with `MemoryError`. But `modify` needs a named,
  running sandbox, and today's tier destroys the guest after one command, so
  there is no moment to issue it. The 141 ms is real, recoverable, and
  reachable only once guests persist.
- **The ordering inverts on macOS.** `microvm` runs a realistic short command
  in 474 ms against `process` at 1604 ms and `supervised` at 1629 ms, because
  those two add ~1.5 s to Python startup under Seatbelt while the VM adds
  none. The strongest tier is the quickest of the three here. That Seatbelt
  cost is undiagnosed, is not a fixed cost reuse can hide, and belongs to its
  own investigation rather than to this milestone — but it means "microvm is
  the slow tier" was never quite the right framing on this platform.

**Second, amortize the boot: session-scoped guest reuse. Built 2026-08-13, and
it delivered 10.7×.** Fixed cost per command fell from **461.0 ms to 43.0 ms**,
which makes `microvm` the *cheapest* of the four tiers on this host —
`workspace` is 53.0 ms, `process` 62.9 ms, `supervised` 98.9 ms. The strongest
boundary is now also the least expensive to cross, because what is left at
every tier is h5i's own CLI overhead and this path has the least host-side
machinery to set up.

`crates/h5i-sandbox/src/microvm.rs` grew a warm path beside the one-shot one,
which stays and is still reachable by `H5I_MICROVM_NO_REUSE=1` — the escape
hatch, and the per-command-freshness option 9. promises. **The guest name is a
SHA-256 over its own create argv** (`h5i-<box>-<digest12>`), which is what makes
the fail-closed rule structural instead of a check somebody has to remember:
image, mounts, memory or egress change → different name → new guest → the old
one reaped, so a box can never be served a guest still enforcing a policy it no
longer has. Verified end to end: widening a box's allowlist rotated it from
`…08839c…` to `…a4d7c6…`, the old guest was reaped, and the new one enforced
the wider list. Deliberately *not* the pinned policy digest, which excludes the
runtime-only mounts by design.

Per-run credentials reach the guest through one small host-owned directory
mounted at `/.h5i/run` rather than `msb exec -e`, preserving the property this
module exists for — no value ever appears in a host command line — and the
staged script is unlinked when the run ends. `cache_write` runs stay one-shot,
being the only ones whose mount set differs from the box's.

Two things the build found that the design had not:

- **The 25 ms completion poll became the dominant cost** once the boot was
  gone. It was flagged in the very first benchmark (2026-07-19) as inflating a
  4 ms command to 30 ms, and it turned a 9 ms exec into 35 ms. A backoff
  (1 ms doubling to 25 ms) brought h5i's reported wall to 10 ms, matching the
  runtime's own cost, and the fixed cost from 65.5 ms to 43.0 ms.
- **The orphan sweep had never reaped anything.** `marker_path("").parent()`
  walked up past the marker directory (joining an empty component leaves a
  trailing separator), so it scanned `/tmp` for names that live one level down,
  matched nothing, and said nothing, being best-effort throughout. Harmless
  while guests died with their process; not harmless now that they outlive it.
  Fixed, with a test.

A security review of the branch reported no exploitable finding, and closed two
candidates for reasons worth keeping: the unvalidated-name path into
`msb remove --force` was **pre-existing and strictly more reachable before**
this work (the `parent()` bug meant the sweep read `/tmp` itself, so a marker
needed no directory squat at all), and the 48-bit name digest is not grindable
by anyone in the threat model — `sanitize_label`'s output is not in the hash
input, so the box-controlled half of the name buys no freedom over it, and a
colliding guest would mount a different workspace and fail loudly rather than
run under a laxer allowlist.

It did surface a real multi-user correctness bug, now fixed. **Markers decided
which VMs get destroyed while living in a directory shared between logins.** On
a shared Linux host whoever ran the tier first owned `/tmp/h5i-msb-live`;
everyone else's marker writes then failed silently, so their guests were never
reaped — and worse, their sweeps read the *first* user's markers and saw
`exists() == false` for a workspace under a home they cannot traverse,
concluding a live box was gone and removing its VM. Three changes: the marker
directory is now per-user (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/h5i/msb-live`, falling back to a
uid-scoped temp path) and is refused unless it is a real directory this user
owns that nobody else can write; `box_is_gone` distinguishes a definite
`NotFound` from "cannot look", so an unreadable workspace costs a leaked VM
rather than a destroyed one; and only names shaped like the ones this module
emits (`h5i-` plus lowercase alphanumerics and dashes) may reach the runtime at
all, which also means no marker can present a flag-shaped argument to `msb`.

The original analysis, and what it was measured against:

**The prerequisite was answered — `msb` supports this, and it is measured.** `msb create --name X`
boots a guest detached and `msb exec X -- cmd` attaches to it over its agent
relay socket without booting. Measured on the same host: **233.9 ms cold per
command against 8.4 ms warm, 28× on the `msb` primitive alone**, and the warm
path is independent of guest size (8.9 ms into an 8 GiB guest, the same as
into a 512 MiB one), so reuse absorbs the memory cost of the previous
paragraph as well. Against h5i's 461 ms of fixed cost, a warm guest reachable
in ~9 ms is roughly **50×**. State persists across execs as expected.

So the shape is: boot on a box's first command, exec later commands into the
same guest, tear down with the box or an idle timer. This is backend-neutral
and it is the only speed move that works on macOS, where libkrun has no
snapshot or restore and fork-from-warm cannot exist. It is also the
architectural unlock for three gaps 9. lists as costs: a persistent guest is
what background services (`box service`), port-based share, and an in-guest
tee shim each require before they can be built at this tier.

**The semantics question is decided, and 9. now states it: reuse is the
default.** Reuse means commands in a box stop getting a pristine guest each
time, which reads as a weakening until you notice that `workspace`,
`process`, `supervised` and `container` have all always shared state across a
box's commands — the worktree is the whole point of a box. Per-command
amnesia at `microvm` is an artifact of shelling to a one-shot `msb run`, not a
promise the tier made, so ending it is alignment rather than a loss. The
boundary that carries the security claim is box↔host and box↔box, and neither
changes: separate boxes still get separate guests. Recreation per command
stays available for anyone who wants today's behaviour; it just stops being
the only option. The one hard requirement is the digest rule in 9. — a guest
whose policy has changed underneath it is recreated, never reused.

Not borrowed from forkd here, deliberately. Their answer to the same question
is "fork a fresh child per task", which needs a memory-fork primitive `msb`
does not have (its snapshots are disk-only and offline) and economics we do
not have (~20–100 ms to re-create, against our 237–460 ms). It is also the
weakest part of their implementation: `DESIGN.md:118-128` describes per-child
overlayfs in the present tense, `grep` finds no overlayfs anywhere in the
shipped code, and children in fact share one read-write rootfs file whose
writes are cross-visible and durable — a cross-sandbox channel their
`SECURITY.md` does not mention. The transferable lesson is the one their
`/tmp`-as-tmpfs convention encodes (name one place where guest-local writable
state belongs) plus the negative one: a design doc that drifts into the
present tense about unbuilt behaviour is how that happens.

It should carry the memory trick from step 1, because a persistent guest is
what makes it usable: `msb create --memory 512M --max-memory <ceiling>` boots
at 237 ms instead of 384 ms, one `msb modify --memory <ceiling>` at ~9 ms
restores the enforced cap, and every exec after that is ~9 ms. That removes
the +154 ms from the one boot per box which reuse alone cannot amortise, and
the enforcement claim survives it. Two constraints the measurements attach to
it: the resize is asynchronous, so a box whose first command immediately wants
4 GiB may meet a guest that has not converged yet and needs the modify issued
at create time rather than lazily; and **an exec can hang** (see the anomaly in
`docs/benchmarks/microvm-boot.md` — twice in ~100, undiagnosed, unreproduced
in 6 controlled attempts), so exec needs its own deadline the way `wait_vm`
already gives `msb run` a host-side backstop.

**Six prerequisites measured before writing any of it (2026-08-13), because
two assumptions had already died that way.** None reshaped the design; one
resized it. **A state check costs ~7.5 ms** (`msb list --format json`, the
cheapest of list/status/ping), which is the same order as the exec it guards,
so checking before every command roughly *doubles* per-command cost to ~16 ms
rather than being free — still ~29× better than today, but it means one list
per run, not one per decision, and it is the reason to keep guest state in the
box manifest rather than re-derive it. **Mounts are live in both directions**:
a host write after boot is visible inside a running guest and vice versa,
which is what lets per-run credentials go through the existing `/.h5i/spool`
mount instead of `msb exec -e`. **`--timeout` enforces exactly** (2 s killed at
2.02 s, `rc=1`, "exec timed out after 2s"), so the profile wall clock survives
the switch. **`--tty` works under a real pty** (guest reports `/dev/pts/0`,
`TERM=xterm-256color`) and `--no-tty` under a pipe, so `box shell` and captured
runs both keep their current shapes. **Eight concurrent execs into one guest**
all returned their own correct output in 26 ms of wall clock, so a single warm
guest is not a serialization point — which is what later makes `box service`
and the browser sidecar plausible here. And **names take 128 characters,
dots and underscores, but reject `/`**, so a box id like `env/human/slug` must
be sanitized before it can carry a policy digest in the guest name.

**h5i must track guest state, and `msb exec`'s auto-start is a trap.** An
earlier draft of this section said the opposite, on the strength of upstream's
"exec auto-starts a stopped sandbox" — measurement corrected it. Exec into a
**running** guest is 8.5–9.3 ms. Exec into a **stopped** one is ~236 ms *and
leaves it stopped*, so it is a one-shot boot wearing the fast path's name:
every later exec pays the same again and the guest never re-warms. An explicit
`msb start` (~143 ms) is what returns it to `running`, after which execs are
9.3 ms again. So an idle timeout that stops a guest silently reverts the tier
to its current per-command cost, permanently, until something starts it — the
reuse design has to own the state machine rather than lean on exec's
convenience.

Four more things the upstream check turned up that the design has to carry.
`--idle-timeout` and `--max-duration` exist but **have no default**, so a
detached guest outlives its box unless h5i sets one — the orphan-marker sweep
becomes load-bearing rather than a backstop, and `msb touch` is what keeps a
guest alive during an active session. `msb exec` takes `-e KEY=value` on argv,
which is the same `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` exposure the preload script exists to
avoid, so that mechanism carries over unchanged and costs ~9 ms. There is **no
daemon** — 0.2.x's `msb server` is gone and each sandbox is its own detached
host process, so a pool's ceiling is host RAM. And the upstream repo has moved
from `microsandbox/microsandbox` to `superradcompany/microsandbox`, so the
references in our docs and error strings will rot. The lifecycle shape to
extend is `SandboxGuard` and the orphan-marker sweep in
`crates/h5i-sandbox/src/microvm.rs`, which already own naming and cleanup.

**Third, on Linux only, a second backend: fork-from-warm — and step 1 lowered
its priority.** Reuse gets a command to ~9 ms, so what remains for
fork-from-warm is the *first* command of a box and fan-out across many boxes
at once, not the steady state. It should be judged on that narrower prize
rather than on the 50× headline, which step 2 already collects. Worth noting
for the same reason: `msb` does have snapshots, but they are **disk-only and
offline** — a stopped sandbox, no memory image — so the warm-fork primitive
cannot be built on the macOS backend even in principle, and this step stays a
Linux-only second backend rather than something to retrofit.

The prize is a prewarmed agent snapshot — a parent guest with the agent CLI,
node, and toolchain already resident — so a microvm box's *first* command
skips a boot plus an agent cold start. forkd's pack format (sha256-pinned
snapshot bundles on a serverless registry) is a distribution story parallel
to our OCI images. The adapter seams are
narrow and already isolated: the `Runtime` enum, the pure and fully-tested
`build_run_argv`, and the two dispatch sites in `sandbox.rs`. The catch is
disqualifying until fixed: forkd has no default-deny egress — its own
README says so — and this tier advertises `egress_enforced_l3`, so under
the fail-closed rule a forkd backend refuses every profile with an egress
allowlist, which is most of them. The candidate closure is the netns forkd
already gives each child: a netns is a natural L3 enforcement point, and
the same egress-rule grammar the msb translation compiles from
(`container::parse_egress_rule`) can compile to nftables rules programmed
into it. That fix is upstreamable, the way forkd upstreamed its own
Firecracker `MAP_SHARED` patch.

**Not borrowed, deliberately.** The live-BRANCH stack — vendored
Firecracker, userfaultfd write-protect, a seccomp workaround — is the
highest-maintenance part of forkd and "start boxes fast" does not need it:
plain restore-from-warm-snapshot works on stock Firecracker. KSM tuning is
skipped on forkd's own negative result, and hugepages wait until the first
step's measurements say the tail matters. And the core CoW primitive does
not port to macOS at all — forkd's design doc rules macOS out because the
mechanism *is* the host kernel's copy-on-write over `mmap(MAP_PRIVATE)` —
so the macOS story stays msb plus reuse, and the platform split is stated,
not smoothed over.

### M14. `box service` at the microvm tier: built, 2026-08-14

Services are the first of the three things M13 step 2 unlocks, and the one the
other two wait on: a dev server has to exist before it can be shared or driven
by a browser. `spawn_background` refuses every tier but `workspace` and
`process` today, and the reason is not a missing feature — it is that **every
mechanism in the service machinery is a host-process mechanism**, and a guest
process is not a host process.

| What a service needs | How it works today | Why it does not survive the boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | a host pid from `spawn_background` | a guest process has no host pid |
| Liveness | `pid_alive(rec.pid)` | asks the host about a guest pid |
| Stop | `killpg` after `setsid` | cannot signal into the guest |
| Logs | the child writes a host file directly | the guest cannot see a host path |
| Ports | a *host* port allocated and injected as `PORT` | the server binds inside the guest; nothing listens on the host |

**The one that is dangerous rather than merely absent** is identity, and it
decides the shape of the whole design. `ServiceRecord.pid` is a host pid, and a
guest pid put in the same field is not a different value — it is the *same
number in a different namespace*. `pid_alive` would answer about an unrelated
host process, and `service_stop`'s `killpg` would signal an unrelated host
**process group**. So the record has to say where the pid lives, every consumer
has to dispatch on that, and the host signal path has to **refuse** a guest
record rather than fall through to the pid it cannot interpret.

The design, then:

**A record says which world its pid belongs to.** `ServiceRecord` gains a
runtime discriminator carrying the guest name, `serde`-defaulted to the host
variant so records written before this still parse. That name is also the
cheapest liveness precondition there is: if it is not the box's *current* guest
name, the service is dead by construction, because a policy change rotated the
guest — no exec required to know it. Which is the second thing to state plainly:
**rotating a guest kills its services**, since the guest is the machine they
run on, and the records must be invalidated when it happens.

**Launch is an exec that detaches.** `msb exec <guest> -- sh -c 'cd /work &&
setsid nohup sh -c "<cmd>" >/.h5i/services/<name>.log 2>&1 & echo $!'`, taking
the printed guest pid. `setsid` makes it a session leader, so a later
`kill -TERM -<pid>` reaps the whole descendant tree — the same semantics the
kernel tiers get from `killpg`, which is why the same `setsid` appears in
`spawn_background`. Measured to survive: a server started this way answered
after unrelated execs in between (`docs/benchmarks/microvm-exec-tunnel.md`).

**Logs go through a mount, not a pipe.** `<env_dir>/services` mounted
read-write at `/.h5i/services`, the guest redirecting into it, the host reading
the same file. `service logs` and the stop-time capture ingest then work
unchanged. The content is box-written and therefore untrusted, which the
existing ingest already assumes — this changes who writes the bytes, not how
they are treated.

**Stop is the same escalation, one exec away.** `kill -TERM -<pgid>`, wait,
escalate to `-KILL`, then ingest the log as evidence exactly as today.

**Ports are guest ports, and `box ports` must say so.** This is the one place
the user-visible semantics genuinely differ, so it should not be papered over.
Two consequences, one of them a simplification:

- *Dynamic allocation stops being necessary.* Host ports are allocated per env
  because concurrent boxes share one host network and would collide. Each
  microvm box has its own network stack, so nothing can collide: the service
  binds the port its definition declares, and `PORT` is injected as that.
- *Nothing on the host listens.* `box ports` at this tier is reporting a port
  inside a machine, and reachability is `box share` — over the exec tunnel
  measured in `docs/benchmarks/microvm-exec-tunnel.md`, not over a published
  port.

**Publishing the port with `msb -p` was considered and rejected.** It is
create-time only, so the set of published ports becomes part of the guest's
identity: changing a service definition would rotate the guest and kill every
service running in it, and a box would carry an ingress hole for its whole life
against the possibility of a share that most boxes never ask for. The tunnel
opens nothing and works even on a `--no-net` box, which is the property worth
protecting.

**What does not change**, and deliberately: the service definition
(`[service.<name>]` in `.h5i/env.toml`, digest-pinned), the records directory,
the event log, the capture ingest at stop, and the whole CLI surface. Only the
execution backend is new — `spawn_background` grows a microvm arm and a return
type that can carry a guest name, rather than a second service subsystem.

**Built, and verified end to end**: a declared service starts in the box's warm
guest, `service status` reports it running, a dev server it starts answers
`HTTP 200` from inside the box, a `box run` in between leaves it untouched,
`service logs` reads the guest's log through the mount, and `service stop`
reaps it and captures the log as evidence.

Four things the build found that the design had not, three of them the same
mistake wearing different clothes — *assuming a host mechanism survives the
boundary*:

- **The guest's identity is only as stable as the policy that builds it.**
  `service_start` prepared a *different* policy than `run`: no capture spool,
  no inbox, no cache mounts, no user egress. Different mounts, different create
  argv, different guest — so starting a service created a second guest and
  reaped the one `box run` was using, and the next `box run` reaped it straight
  back, killing the service every time. Fixed by extracting `prepare_box_reach`
  so both paths grant the same reach from one definition. Then it happened
  *again*, two mounts smaller: the agent-config lockdown mounts are emitted
  only when those files exist, and `run` creates them through
  `ProtectedHookConfigGuard` while `service_start` did not. The lesson is
  sharper than "call the same functions": **anything that makes the create argv
  depend on transient state makes the guest unstable**, and there is now an
  `H5I_DEBUG_MICROVM_ARGV=1` hatch that prints the argv, because the diff
  between two of them is the only thing that shows which element moved.
- **`kill` is a shell builtin, not a binary.** `msb exec … -- kill -0 <pid>`
  returns 127 in a slim image, so every service read as dead and — worse — the
  stop path signalled nothing at all while reporting success. Both go through
  `sh -c` now.
- **`$!` after `setsid` is the wrong pid.** `setsid` forks whenever it must
  create a new session, so `$!` names a parent that exits immediately; the
  recorded pid was dead on arrival, and once the number was recycled it named
  an unrelated process for the stop path to signal. The service now writes its
  own `$$` to a pidfile and then `exec`s, so the recorded pid *is* the service
  and *is* the session leader `kill -TERM -<pid>` reaps as a group.

An adversarial pass over the result found three more, the first of which was
shipping a silent data-loss bug:

- **The idle timeout killed the services.** A guest is created with
  `--idle-timeout 30m`, and `msb` measures idleness in *commands* — it cannot
  see that a dev server inside is busy serving. So a service died 30 minutes
  after the operator's last h5i command, while still handling traffic, and the
  box looked fine. Measured rather than reasoned about: a guest with a 20 s
  bound stopped at ~25 s and took its service with it. A box that declares
  services now gets **no** idle bound (`ResolvedPolicy::hosts_services`, read
  from the pinned `[service.*]` set, which is known at create time — the bound
  cannot be changed later). Such a guest is reclaimed by `box rm` and by the
  sweep instead. The two are different guests by name, which is right: whether
  a box may be stopped is part of what its guest is.
- **Nothing had a deadline.** `service_alive`, `guest_state`, and guest
  create/start all blocked forever. Given an `msb exec` that has been seen to
  hang — rarely, still undiagnosed — `box service status` would hang with it,
  with no way out but Ctrl-C. All of them now run under `run_bounded`; a query
  that overruns reads as "not running", which is the safe direction.
- **The escape hatch broke services silently.** With `H5I_MICROVM_NO_REUSE=1`,
  a service would have been started in a warm guest while every `box run` got
  its own throwaway one — so the box could never reach its own service, and
  nothing would look wrong. Starting a service now refuses under that flag and
  says why.

A second review round, aimed at the fixes the first one produced, found nine
more. Two are worth stating because they are the same mistake at different
depths, and both were introduced *by* a fix:

- **"I could not read the answer" is not "there is nothing there."** Round one
  fixed `guest_state` so a failed or timed-out `msb list` no longer read as
  `Absent` — because `Absent` is answered with `create --replace`, which
  destroys a live guest and every service in it. Round two found the same bug
  one layer down: `parse_guest_state` still returned `Absent` when the output
  parsed as anything other than an array, so a banner line on stdout would have
  done it on *every command*. Worse, the unit test asserted that behaviour, so
  the bug had a test defending it. Only a well-formed list that does not name
  the guest is `Absent` now; everything else is `Unknown`.
- **A guest name is not a guest life.** A guest keeps its name across
  `stop`/`start` and restarts its pids from 1, so a stale record naming pid 42
  could match an unrelated process in the guest's next life — refusing a start
  that should succeed, and signalling a process group that was never ours. The
  record now carries the guest's kernel boot id, and a mismatch reads as dead.

The rest: the service launcher was the last runtime call without a deadline;
`wait_exec` joined its reader threads after killing the child, reintroducing
the hang its own deadline exists to prevent; crashed runs left brokered
credentials in a directory the long-lived guest can read, so it is swept before
each use; `live_service_ports` still called host `pid_alive` on a record that
may hold a guest pid, safe only by an accident of ordering; `env shell` was the
one entry point never routed through `prepare_box_reach`, leaving the
"one construction site" invariant true only by coincidence; and the benchmark
harness resolved workload binaries on the host and executed them in the guest,
which would abort the sweep for the very tier it exists to measure.

Then, and only then, share (M15): the tunnel is measured and the isolation
property is verified, but its remaining unknown is the in-guest forwarder — no
slim image carries `nc` or `socat`, and `/dev/tcp` is a bash builtin — so a
small static binary staged into a mounted directory is the first thing that
work has to decide.

### M17. The remote runner: R13.1 built, 2026-08-16

A box placed on a second Linux machine, driven from the local h5i over SSH.
Not a new isolation tier: a second axis, *placement*, beside the tier the box
already declares. The repo, the manifest, policy resolution, receipts, and
every credential stay on this machine; the other machine runs the same `h5i`
binary as a per-connection worker under an SSH forced command, executes the
container tier there, and hands back a quarantined git bundle the host turns
into the same reviewable patch as today. The design authority is sections R1
to R13, including the four sub-milestones (R13) and the decision points named
there. **R13.1 — the crate, the protocol, pairing and probing — is built and
verified against a real sshd**; R13.2 to R13.4 are not.

### M18. Runtime detection: a kernel-observed lane, 2026-08-19

An eBPF collector that watches a run from the kernel and puts what it saw in
the run's receipt. Every evidence lane h5i had until now sits either at the
boundary of the box (h5i as the parent process, the CONNECT proxy) or inside
it (the tee shim, the browser), so each is defeated by the box declining to
cooperate or by work happening below the outermost command. This lane is
neither: the kernel reports `execve`, `connect` and `openat` whether or not
anything in the box wanted them reported. It is observation only — nothing
here can deny anything, and denial stays with Landlock, seccomp, the netns
and the egress proxy — and it is `enabled = false` by default because it
needs `CAP_BPF`, which an ordinary install does not have. The design
authority is sections D1 to D14. **All five sub-milestones (D14) are built.**
What is not demonstrated: the live attach path has been exercised only where
the capability exists, so on a stock unprivileged install the honest answer
this ships with is the `unavailable` block naming the missing capability.

## 9. Limits we state up front

Being explicit about these is a feature, since the claim is a security claim.

- **The agent can send your source to the model API.** Containment stops the
  agent from touching the host. It does not stop it from putting private code in
  a prompt. That is a separate control (self hosted model, or no model egress at
  all) and we will not imply otherwise.
- **Shared kernel, unless you pick the microVM tier.** Podman and the kernel
  tiers share the host kernel. Good against a runaway agent and against careless
  dependency code. Not a claim against a targeted kernel exploit. The answer
  ships as `isolation=microvm`, a microsandbox (`msb`) backend that boots the
  same OCI images into a guest with its own kernel and filters egress by address
  in the VM's network stack. What it costs is honest and stated in MANUAL.md: it
  needs host virtualization (`/dev/kvm`, or Apple Silicon), it produces no
  per-request egress tally, and it does not yet route the authenticated-egress
  credential proxy. **Demonstrated end to end 2026-08-13** on Apple Silicon
  with `msb` 0.6.8: a box creates, runs, enforces its allowlist in the guest
  netstack, and exits 0. Two costs are now measured rather than assumed
  (`docs/benchmarks/microvm-boot.md`). It **was** a full boot per command,
  461 ms of it, because the guest was torn down after each one; **M13 step 2
  (built 2026-08-13) gives each box one guest instead, and the per-command cost
  is now 43 ms** — the cheapest of the four tiers on this host. What that costs
  is stated one bullet down: a box's commands share a guest, as they already
  shared everything at every other tier. The **8 GiB memory cap still costs
  ~154 ms** at roughly 20 ms per GiB, but it is now paid once per box rather
  than once per command, which is why recovering it via `msb`'s hotplug
  (`--max-memory` plus a live `msb modify`) was measured, understood, and then
  deliberately not built: it trades an async convergence window for a one-time
  saving. The Linux/KVM path remains unmeasured.
- **A box is the trust domain, not a command.** Successive commands in one box
  share state, and that is the point rather than a leak: the workspace
  persists, which is what a box *is* — a worktree plus a branch plus an agent
  session, whose commands are meant to be related (build, then test, then
  commit). So the boundary we claim is box↔host and box↔box. It is never
  command↔command, at any tier. An agent that leaves a file behind or a
  process running will meet them again on its next command, and a run that
  depends on the previous one having happened is a supported way to use a box,
  not a misuse of it.

  **The `microvm` tier joined them on 2026-08-13** (M13 step 2). It used to
  boot a guest per command and destroy it after, so guest-local state did not
  survive to the next command — an artifact of shelling to a one-shot `msb
  run` rather than a promise the tier made. Now a box gets one guest, so its
  commands share `/tmp`, the process table, and anything written outside the
  mounted workspace, exactly as they already did everywhere else.
  `H5I_MICROVM_NO_REUSE=1` restores a fresh guest per command for anyone who
  wants it.

  Three things hold. The durable work product lives in `/work`, a host mount,
  so it outlives the guest either way. **Reuse is scoped to one box under one
  configuration**: the guest's name is a hash of the argv that created it, so a
  changed profile, allowlist, image or mount set resolves to a different guest
  and the previous one is reaped — a box cannot be served a guest still
  enforcing a policy it no longer has, and this is structural rather than a
  check that could be forgotten. The corollary is worth stating: **guest-local
  state does not survive a policy change**, because that is a different guest
  by construction. And separate boxes still get separate guests, so nothing
  about box↔box isolation changes.
- **A microvm box that declares a service keeps its guest until you remove it.**
  A guest is normally stopped after 30 minutes idle. A box whose
  `.h5i/env.toml` declares any `[service.*]` gets no such bound, because `msb`
  measures idleness in commands and cannot see a dev server busy serving —
  the bound would kill the service it was meant to protect, and it is fixed
  when the guest is created, so it cannot be lifted later. The cost is real
  and stated rather than hidden: such a box holds its `mem_bytes` allocation
  from its first command until `box rm`, **even if the service is never
  started**. Declared is the signal because started is not knowable in time.
  `box rm` and the orphan sweep are what reclaim it.
- **The container tier's egress scoping is L7.** Its allowlist is a proxy, so
  it binds proxy respecting tooling only. The `supervised` tier enforces at
  L3/L4 with nftables and does not have that hole, which is why M4 starts
  there.
- **Chrome runs with its own sandbox off.** Our seccomp deny list blocks the
  namespace syscalls Chrome's sandbox needs, at every tier. h5i's box is the
  boundary; Chrome's is not available inside it. That is one layer fewer than a
  browser on the host has.
- **Linux and macOS, by different means.** Linux confines with Landlock, seccomp
  and namespaces; macOS confines with Seatbelt, and its `supervised` tier gets
  its egress allowlist from the same host side proxy the container tier uses,
  pinned by an SBPL rule that leaves the box no other outbound route. Two real
  gaps on macOS: no syscall filter (Darwin has no seccomp) and no memory cap
  (no cgroups, and `RLIMIT_AS` is not enforced against an mmap'd heap). Rootless
  Podman runs natively on Linux and WSL2, and through a `podman machine` VM on
  macOS.
- **Cost.** A Chrome sidecar is still real RAM and CPU, even headless. Headless
  boxes must stay first class, and the browser must be opt in per box.
- **The viewport is not a desktop.** CDP screencast shows the page. Native
  dialogs, browser chrome and anything outside the tab are invisible until the
  full-desktop tier lands.
- **A dependency on the critical path.** agent-browser is someone else's
  release cadence. Pinned, CLI-boundary, forkable, but not ours.
- **A share is a door, and `--tunnel` is a wider one.** `h5i box share` is the
  only path that lets traffic *into* a box, and it is opt-in, expiring and
  revocable per peer. The peer-to-peer transport is end-to-end encrypted and a
  relay, if one is needed, moves sealed packets. `--tunnel` is not end to end:
  Cloudflare terminates TLS and can read the traffic. That is a reasonable trade
  for a prototype and it is never ours to assume, so it is printed when the
  share starts and written into the box's receipt, not just documented here.
  Two smaller edges: authorization is checked when a connection is established
  and live connections are dropped within about a second of a revoke rather than
  instantly; and the page a joiner opens is agent-written code running in their
  browser, on a loopback origin that browsers exempt from private-network
  protections, which is the one place `--tunnel`, on a public origin, is
  actually the safer of the two.
- **Browser mediation is enforcement, not containment.** The socket mediator
  (M8) decides every verb the agent's CLI sends, which is the threat the
  control lock was written for: an agent that does not know a human took the
  wheel. It is not a boundary against an agent that goes looking, because the
  daemon runs *inside* the box and a box has no internal privilege boundary.
  Landlock grants are per-box, not per-process, so any socket the daemon can
  bind the agent can reach directly. Moving the daemon outside the box would
  close that and break the reason boxes exist: it could no longer reach the
  dev server on the box's own loopback.

## 10. Decisions taken

- **The name stays `h5i`.** The five dimensions story goes away, the name does
  not. Domain, install base, and binary name carry over untouched.
- **Distribution is the CLI plus a skill.** One Rust binary, no server, and
  `skills/h5i/` installed with `npx skills add h5i-dev/h5i`, mirroring
  `h5i-db`. The repo layout changes to make that the front door (6.).
- **The binary emits the skill.** `skills/h5i/` is embedded at build time and
  `h5i skill install` writes it out, which is how it reaches the inside of a
  box. Version drift disappears, and the in box copy can be rendered with that
  box's actual policy (6.1).
- **The browser layer is agent-browser** (Apache-2.0, native Rust), for both
  automation and the human viewport stream. We do not reimplement Neko's core,
  and the whole X/GStreamer/PulseAudio stack drops out of the design. h5i keeps
  the boundary, the control lock, the policy and the receipts (7.). A
  full-desktop tier, with Neko as its reference, is deferred until something
  actually needs more than a page viewport.
- **Warm caches are in scope.** Read only per project cache volumes, written
  only by a dedicated refresh box with no agent in it (5.8).
- **The receipt may be generated in the box**, provided the agent cannot
  rewrite it. That is bought today by sealing (the receipt store sits outside
  every write grant the box has) plus two host observed fields for cross
  checking. The inherited-fd writer stays on the table as the stronger form
  (5.7).
- **`AF_UNIX` is a profile grant, not a tier property.** The supervised
  tier's `socket()` gate denies the family by default, because `SCM_RIGHTS`
  passes file descriptors. A profile opts in (`[profile.X.net] unix = true`),
  and it is pinned in the digest. Granting it tier-wide to make one daemon work
  would have widened every box to buy one; the `browser` profile asks, and
  nothing else does.
- **The programmable surface is the CLI's JSON contract, not a daemon.** An SDK
  is a thin subprocess wrapper around the binary (the `remote-agent-browser`
  shape, about 1,200 lines), published only after the first buyer workflow is
  demonstrated. `create`/`run`/`export` gained `--json` on 2026-08-05, which
  closes the loop the contract needs (6.2).
- **The terminal viewer is an in-process client of the box's stream, and
  terminal-browser is a reference, not a base** (5.10). It enters the box's
  namespaces the way the forward does and takes the socket over `SCM_RIGHTS`,
  so it binds no port and needs no token. The forward's token exists because
  the forward has to listen, and this does not. The host gains one module and
  three small dependencies: no Electron, no host Chromium, no input helper.
  The box side is unchanged, so nothing in the boundary or the policy moved.
  Both viewers write one receipt lane through one function, because two
  near-identical formats is how an export ends up describing the same session
  two different ways.
- **No MCP.** `mcp.rs` and the `h5i_env_*` tools go with the rest. The premise
  of MCP here was a host side agent reaching into a box, which is the shape this
  product exists to eliminate. The agent is inside the box, and inside the box
  the interface is the CLI plus the skill. There is no second interface to keep
  in sync, and no tool schema to drift from the flags.

## 11. Still open

1. **Enforcing the control lock on the agent's side.** The lock is designed and
   the viewer honours it: input from a human reaches the page only while they
   hold it. What is *not* wired is the other direction: `control::check` exists
   and returns `HeldByHuman` / `NeedsResnapshot` with the message an agent
   should see, and nothing calls it. So an agent running `agent-browser click`
   during a human takeover is not refused today; it is only told, if it asks.
   The gap is the interception point, not the policy: there is no h5i process
   between the agent and `agent-browser` at the kernel tiers, so this needs a
   decision about where the check lives (a PATH shim, a skill-level convention,
   or accepting that it is advisory) rather than more code in `control.rs`.

   **Answered, 2026-08-07: the mediated socket (7.2, M8), built.** The
   daemon's NDJSON control socket was a fourth option the original list
   missed, and the only one the agent cannot route around: a PATH shim can be
   bypassed by calling the binary by path, a convention enforces nothing, and
   the socket is the one door every verb walks through.
   `crates/h5i-core/src/browser_proxy.rs` decides every line against
   `control::check` and a per-profile action policy, answers refusals in the
   daemon's own shape, and records each action into a host-observed
   `browser-proxy` receipt lane. **Verified against the real `agent-browser`
   CLI** (`tests/browser_mediation.rs`): a read passes through and returns the
   real page, a denied `eval` is refused and never evaluated, and a click
   during a human takeover is refused while reads keep working.

   Three findings, none available by reading:

   - **`__agent_browser_internal_shutdown` is an escape hatch, not an
     action.** The CLI sends it when it decides the running daemon does not
     match the options it wants, then starts its own. Forwarded naively it
     kills the daemon we mediate and the replacement is the agent's, on a
     socket we do not own: mediation gone, with no error anywhere. It is
     refused unconditionally.
   - **`launch` is not a page change.** The CLI prefixes every command with
     it, so classifying it as mutating refuses it during a takeover and takes
     every read-only verb down with it, the opposite of 5.4's rule that
     watching never collides.
   - **The daemon's config fingerprint covers its options, not its path**, so
     the real daemon can run on a path the box cannot reach with the mediator
     in front, provided h5i launches it with the environment the box's CLI
     will compute and mirrors `.version`/`.config` into the box-visible dir.

   **The lifecycle landed too, and is enforced by default.** The daemon is
   started by the *shim* rather than by h5i directly, which is what makes the
   split possible at all: the shim already runs inside the box and invokes the
   real binary twice, so it starts the daemon on a private path
   (`/tmp/agent-browser-daemon`), mirrors the `.version`/`.config`/`.stream`
   files the CLI checks, and then execs the CLI against the mediated path.
   h5i's listener binds *before* the box runs. Waiting for a daemon first
   would mean the box's own first call finds the mediated path empty and
   starts an unmediated daemon on it, then connects upstream lazily.

   Verified in a real supervised box: `agent-browser open` works through the
   chain, the real daemon's socket lives in the private directory while the
   visible one holds only mirrored files, a read passes through, and
   `agent-browser eval` comes back
   `✗ \`evaluate\` is denied for this box by its profile's browser action
   policy (fail-closed)` with `browser mediation (2 action(s), 1 refused)` on
   the receipt log.

   Two more findings from that run. **Not every agent-browser word is a
   command**. `url` and `status` are not, and using one to start the daemon
   fails silently and leaves no daemon and no clue; `open about:blank` is the
   cheap start that works. And **a box whose repo lives under `/tmp` cannot
   see its own shim**: the per-env `/tmp` scratch shadows the host path the
   shim sits on, `agent-browser` falls through to the system binary, and
   mediation is bypassed with nothing to indicate it. That is the same
   shadowing the M4 notes record, arriving somewhere new.

   Related and now much smaller: **snapshot handle staleness across a takeover**
   is modelled: `needs_resnapshot` is set on the take, survives a session that
   never hands back, and clears only on an actual snapshot. It rests on the same
   unenforced check.
2. **First buyer workflow.** The positioning is broad enough to become a
   platform pitch, which sells to nobody. The launch message should be one
   workflow: run untrusted or AI generated code, see it in a real browser, keep
   it off your machine.

   **Candidate, 2026-08-07: name the runtime.** "h5i Browser: the browser
   that runs where your coding agent runs." Kitesurf and Lightpanda are
   browsers for agents browsing the web; this is a browser runtime for coding
   agents building the web, and the demo is the full loop of section 8, which
   already exists. It is packaging over M4-M7 plus M8, not new engineering,
   with two constraints held from section 10: no separate binary (the surface
   stays `h5i browser`, one-binary decision) and the wording is "an
   agent-native browser runtime powered by Chromium", never an engine claim,
   until M10 makes one true. The demo surface is M11's developer view.
3. **Publishing `@h5i/sdk`.** Blocked on item 2 by decision, not by code: the
   JSON contract it wraps is complete (6.2). First release scope is
   `create`/`exec`/`browser`/`diff`/`export`/`close`, TypeScript only, binary
   fetched on postinstall. No `agent.run()` until the resident session shape is
   settled, and Python only when someone asks for it.
4. **How engine selection grows from explicit to routed (7.1 step 2).**
   **Deprioritised 2026-08-08 (§12.3): a box picks one engine at creation and
   keeps it.** The first step is **built (M9, 2026-08-07)**: `[profile.X] engine = "..."` and
   `--engine`, pinned in the digest, refusing by name when the engine's
   tooling is absent, with no `auto` and no fallback. One correction the build
   forced: 7.1 claimed the knob's shape is "any CDP endpoint … the slot M10's
   binary later fills with no new plumbing", and that is **wrong**:
   `h5i-browser-light` does not speak CDP, so agent-browser cannot drive it
   and h5i runs it directly (`BrowserEngine::driven_by_agent_browser`). The
   remaining sequence is unchanged: a `--browser auto` heuristic as a later
   explicit opt-in, and per-origin routing last. What is not designed
   is the routing step itself: agent-browser is one engine per daemon
   session, so "loopback gets Chromium, the web gets the light engine" needs
   either two sessions with h5i choosing at navigate time, or the mediation
   layer of 7.2 doing the choosing per action. The second is cleaner and is
   one more reason M8 goes first. Wherever it lands, routing inherits M9's
   rule: an engine switch is a policy change, so it belongs in the digest and
   the receipt, never in a silent fallback.
5. **Build versus adopt for the lightweight visual engine (M10).** Kitesurf's announced
   open-sourcing decides how much of the M10 crate is ours to write. Until
   that drop, the only commitment is the shape: fetch through our proxy,
   receipts as the network log, script off by default for untrusted origins.
6. **The microvm plan's gating questions (M13): one answered, one still
   open, one new.**

   **Answered 2026-08-13: `msb` holds a sandbox open and execs into it.**
   `msb create --name X` boots detached, `msb exec X -- cmd` attaches over
   the guest's agent relay socket without booting, and `exec` auto-starts a
   stopped sandbox so h5i need not track guest state. Measured at 8.4 ms warm
   against 233.9 ms cold. The reuse step needs no upstream ask; what it needs
   is an idle timeout, because `--idle-timeout` has no default and a detached
   guest otherwise outlives its box.

   **Still open: default-deny egress inside forkd's per-child netns.**
   Whether the existing egress-rule grammar can compile to nftables rules
   programmed into it. Without that, a forkd backend fails closed against
   every profile with an egress allowlist and is not worth carrying. This one
   needs a Linux host with KVM, which the 2026-08-13 run did not provide —
   everything measured so far is macOS, and the Linux path is untested.

   **New, and not a microvm question at all: why `process` and `supervised`
   add ~1.5 s to Python startup on macOS.** Found while benchmarking
   something else. It is not a fixed cost, so no amount of reuse hides it,
   and it lands on the tiers macOS users get by default. The suspects are the
   `/usr/bin/python3` Command Line Tools shim and SBPL evaluation over a
   startup that opens hundreds of files; neither is established. Whether it
   reproduces with a non-system interpreter is the cheapest next probe.

## 12. The browser: a local engine that runs script, and the order to build it

> **The work is in [the browser engine sections](#the-browser-engine)**, B1 to
> B14, as of 2026-08-09. This section stays the authority on *scope and why*;
> those are the authority on *order*, and carry the bindings backlog, the
> security items script introduced, and the assessment of Thalora as a source to
> read rather than adopt.

**Rewritten 2026-08-08.** The previous version of this section ordered script
*last* and argued it should wait for the microVM tier. That order has been
reconsidered, and the reasoning that changed it is below. This is a deliberate
change of direction, not an accretion: it widens §3's scope cut, which said keep
`env` and `sandbox` and cut everything else. Read §12.5 before treating any of
it as approved.

### 12.1 What the previous sequence produced

Its first four items are built. Recorded here because the sequence worked, and
because what it found is the argument for the next one.

* **A resident session** (old item 1). `serve` holds a page several viewers and
  a control channel share. Built 2026-08-08, along with the finding that made it
  the only possible shape: `Page` is not `Send`, so one thread owns the page and
  everything else reaches it by channel.
* **A real input surface and an agent interface** (old item 2). `session
  status|snapshot|navigate|scroll|type|submit|click`, plus a cookie jar, so a
  login works end to end. The skill is engine-aware.
* **Untrusted-content marking** (old item 4), pulled forward because it was the
  only item whose absence was a live hole. The snapshot is fenced, and the fence
  rests on a tested one-line invariant rather than on a secret.

Two items remain from that list and survive into this one unchanged in
substance: **action-to-request correlation** (old item 3) and **LOGIN mode with
takeover as a recorded event** (old item 5).

### 12.2 The decision: a local, stateful browser that runs script

Three things moved.

**Two engines does not avoid Chromium.** 7.1 answered "what about script" with
routing: light engine for reading, Chromium for the rest. But
`browser_read_grants()` chains *every* engine's candidates, so an `h5i-light`
box grants Chrome's and agent-browser's paths anyway, and the environment still
installs Chromium, still updates it, still carries its surface. Routing saves
runtime RSS and nothing else. That is the fact that undercuts the two-engine
answer, and it is checkable in this repository rather than a matter of opinion.

**The local position is unoccupied.** Kitesurf is cloud-first: it runs on
Cloudflare Workers and depends on Dynamic Workers, Worker-to-Worker RPC and
Static Assets. The open-sourcing language is "customers can deploy it to their
own Cloudflare account", which is not "runs as a local binary inside a
disposable sandbox next to the repository". Lightpanda runs script and does not
render. Nobody is building a browser that runs script, renders on demand, and
lives inside the coding agent's own sandbox.

**Being one process is an advantage we can take and they cannot.** Kitesurf
serialises a scene from its page realm to a separate renderer because that split
*is* part of its security model. Ours is not: the box is the boundary. So DOM,
style tree, layout tree, display list, tile cache and semantic tree can live in
one process and update incrementally, which is exactly where their own numbers
say the cost is. Cloudflare reports Kitesurf using 3-7x less CPU and memory than
Chromium while being 1.7-1.8x *slower* in wall time, dominated by rasterisation
and image encoding. Measured here independently, release build, 1280x720: encode
5.9ms, alpha flatten 0.84ms, rasterise 1.2ms, whole page load 2.97ms. Two
implementations of the same stack landing on the same bottleneck is evidence
that it is structural.

So the claim is not speed. By Kitesurf's own wall-time numbers this class of
engine is slower than Chromium, and a benchmark table is a claim anyone can beat
by shipping less browser. The claim is the closed loop:

> The agent clicked Add. That click caused exactly one request, `POST
> /api/items`. Here is the receipt, written before the request went out. Here is
> the DOM delta it produced. Here is the frame the human saw.

Chromium cannot produce that line, because its Fetch lane is best-effort and its
records are host-observed at best. Kitesurf cannot easily produce it either,
because the causal link spans its renderer split. It falls out here almost for
free, for one reason: **script makes the receipts story stronger, not weaker.**
Once `fetch` and XHR route through the existing broker, script-initiated traffic
becomes policy-checked and receipted like everything else, which is the lane
where every other engine's evidence is thinnest.

**Engine choice: Boa, chosen rather than benchmarked into.** An earlier draft of
this section made a three-engine shootout the first milestone. That was wrong,
and it is worth saying why rather than quietly dropping it: the urgent thing is a
real browser that works inside the sandbox, and the shootout was a proxy for a
question the vertical slice answers directly. Build the slice, run a real
application, and you have the number the benchmark was estimating.

Boa is the right first engine for a reason stronger than "easiest". It is pure
Rust, so it adds no C toolchain to a build this project has repeatedly paid to
keep hermetic: `system-fonts` was turned off to avoid libfontconfig, and the
cross-check matrix compiles this workspace for windows-msvc, darwin and musl.
That last one is not theoretical. `ring`'s C build already blocks cross-checking
to windows-msvc from a Linux host, and QuickJS or V8 would add another
dependency of exactly that kind to the one crate that is meant to be portable.
Boa costs nothing there.

What Boa costs instead is speed, and the cost should be stated: it is an
interpreter with no JIT, QuickJS generally benchmarks ahead of it, and V8 is an
order of magnitude beyond both. Kitesurf uses V8 for page script and Boa mainly
for `eval`, so Boa carries no precedent for web-app compatibility. A React
production bundle does one large burst of compute at hydration, and that is
where an interpreter is worst.

So the engine sits behind a seam, and the trigger for revisiting it is a
measurement from the real thing rather than a schedule item: **if hydration of
the target application is slow enough to make the Chromium comparison
embarrassing, that is the signal to swap.** Not before. The swap is affordable
precisely because of the next paragraph.

**The asset is the bindings layer, not the engine.** The Rust DOM is the single
source of truth and JS objects are thin wrappers over stable `NodeId`s. A second
tree inside the JS engine would let the snapshot, the paint, the events and the
script state drift apart, and every bug after that is unfixable. Done this way,
swapping Boa for QuickJS or V8 later costs the embedding glue and keeps the
bindings.

### 12.3 What this is not

Named so they can be refused in review rather than argued about each time. None
of these is in scope for the first version, and the README should say **limited
JavaScript preview** rather than "JavaScript support":

CDP and Playwright compatibility. The plugin API. Iframes. Service workers.
WebSocket. Canvas and WebGL. Media. Chrome extensions. Pixel-perfect rendering.
Vite's dev server, HMR and `import.meta.hot`. Cross-origin authenticated
browsing.

CDP is worth its own decision later rather than inheritance now: the argument
for it is not ecosystem access but that agent-browser could then drive this
engine, collapsing two agent interfaces into one. The argument against is that
it is a second full surface next to a verb set that already exists and works.

**And routing, which is the deliberate one.** §11 item 4 sketches a sequence
that ends in per-origin routing: loopback to Chromium, the open web to the light
engine. That is now **low priority, and not a goal of this direction at all.**
A box picks one engine when it is created, and lives with it.

The reason is that two browsers in one box is both heavy and strange. Heavy is
obvious: Chromium's install, its updates and its surface, carried for a box that
may never launch it. Strange is the part worth writing down, because the code
already shows it. `sandbox_policy::browser_read_grants()` grants **every**
engine's binaries rather than the pinned one, on the argument that the engine is
enforced by what h5i launches. But an agent inside the box can invoke the other
binary itself, which `browser_light_env` already concedes when it keeps
`AGENT_BROWSER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` set for an engine that never reads it: "if it
does, this is the only thing standing between it and any host on the internet".
So today the pin is a **launch choice, not a boundary**, and a box pinned to
`h5i-light` still carries a Chromium an agent could start.

Committing to one engine per box is what makes that honest. It narrows what a
browser box installs, lets the grant list follow the pin, and turns the engine
from something h5i happens to launch into something the box cannot step outside
of. Whether the grants should actually narrow is a real question with a real
counter-argument in that function's comment, about keeping the digest
independent of host discovery. It is not settled here. It is only unblocked
here, because it cannot even be asked while routing is a goal.

If routing returns, it returns as an explicit opt-in after the engine can carry
a real application on its own. Building it earlier means paying the two-browser
cost permanently to avoid finishing the one engine that would remove it.

### 12.4 The order

Items 1 to 3 are together what "JavaScript support" means to someone using this.
They are numbered apart because each carries its own design decision, not
because any of them is optional: 1 makes script run, 2 says when its result is
safe to read, 3 is script's network.

1. **Embed Boa, and build the bindings layer, against a production React
   build.** Embedding is the small half: a dependency, a `Context`, and
   evaluating `<script>` text. The bindings are the work, and the reason this
   milestone is named after them. Not a hand-written
   `addEventListener` demo, which proves nothing about the shape of the problem,
   and not the Vite dev server, which drags in WebSocket, HMR and native ESM in
   one step. The surface is roughly: `window`, `document`, `Node`/`Element`/
   `Text`, creation and insertion and removal, attributes, `classList`,
   `querySelector`, `textContent`, events with capture and bubble, `click`/
   `input`/`submit`, promises and the microtask queue, timers,
   `requestAnimationFrame`, `fetch`/`Response`/`Headers`/`URL`, `location`,
   `history`, `console`, `performance`, and invalidation of style, layout and
   paint on mutation. Missing APIs are **logged as unsupported and surfaced in
   the snapshot**, never silently stubbed: an agent needs to know the outline is
   incomplete at the moment it reads it, which is the same rule the fence
   follows.

2. **Quiescence, reported rather than guessed.** "Run JS until settled" is a
   subsystem, not a phrase. No pending microtasks, no timer due inside a stated
   window, no in-flight brokered request, and a hard timeout. Playwright
   deprecated `networkidle` for good reasons. The snapshot states which it was:
   settled after 340ms, or still busy at cutoff. A snapshot that quietly
   returned early is a wrong answer that looks like a right one.

3. **`fetch` through the broker, and the correlation that falls out of it.**
   Old item 3, and in this design it stops being extra work: the engine is the
   one component that knows a click caused a request, and `browser_events`
   already carries `caused_by` for exactly this and currently only wires
   request to response. This is the differentiator, and it is a field we will
   already be holding.

4. **LOGIN mode, and takeover as a recorded policy event.** Old item 5, now
   overdue rather than pending: the cookie jar it was supposed to arrive with
   shipped on 2026-08-08 without it. Until it lands, a human taking over to type
   a password does so on a page the agent can still snapshot.

5. **The comparison, run and published with its caveats.** Same app, same host,
   against Chromium: startup, peak RSS, navigate-to-ready, click-to-DOM-update,
   click-to-visible-frame, idle CPU, binary size. Publish the losses too. If
   click-to-visible-frame is worse, that is a finding about raster and encode
   and it belongs next to the memory win, not behind it. This is also where the
   engine question gets answered: click-to-DOM-update on a real application is
   the number that says whether Boa stays, so the shootout that used to be
   milestone one happens here, once, against something that matters.

### 12.4a Built, 2026-08-09: items 1 to 3

The vertical slice runs. An agent clicks, the page's script executes, its
`fetch` goes through the broker and is receipted, the DOM changes, and the
change is in the outline the agent reads:

```
$ h5i-browser-light session click @e1
{"ok":true,"ref":"@e1","requests":["http://localhost:8231/api/item"],
 "settled":"settled after 0ms"}
```

with all three legs in the request log: the navigation, `/app.js` fetched
*before* it ran, and the `/api/item` the click caused.

**What the shape turned out to be.** The Rust DOM is the single source of truth
and JS objects are wrappers over `NodeId`s, as 12.2 required. What 12.2 did not
anticipate is that the object model itself belongs in a **JavaScript prelude**
rather than in Rust: event listeners, timer callbacks and promise resolvers are
GC-managed values, and holding them on the Rust side means tracing them through
Boa's collector. Putting them where Boa already owns their lifetime left a Rust
surface of about twenty primitives taking ids and strings, and made
capture/bubble propagation ordinary code instead of a lifetime problem.

**Quiescence is a virtual clock.** Promise jobs and timers drain against a clock
the engine advances, not the wall: a page's `setTimeout(1000)` costs an agent
nothing, and two runs of the same page settle identically. That was chosen for
determinism and turned out to matter more than the speed. It is the same
argument as §12.4's "reported rather than guessed", applied to time itself.

**Two things bit, and neither was performance.**

1. **Boa does not compose with our tree.** Boa 0.20+ needs `icu_normalizer
   ~2.0`; `parley`, which Blitz pulls for text, needs `^2.1.1`. Disjoint and
   semver-compatible, so Cargo must unify and cannot. Boa 0.19 uses the 1.x
   line, which is semver-*incompatible* and therefore allowed to coexist, so the
   pin is 0.19 and the build carries two ICU stacks. Upstream has already moved
   `main` to `~2.2.0`, so this unwinds on their next release. Worth noting that
   the first thing to bite was dependency composition rather than speed, which
   is the argument for building before benchmarking, made by accident.
2. **A test hung and looked like a slow build.** Its fake server accepted two
   connections while the test made one, so `join` waited forever. It read as
   compile time, and was diagnosed as compile time, until the user checked. The
   same pattern had already shipped in the cookie tests, where it worked only
   because that test happened to make exactly two requests.

**Boa 0.19's conformance was checked rather than assumed**, since it is two
releases behind: eighteen syntax cases a bundler actually emits (optional
chaining, nullish coalescing, class and private fields, generators,
`Symbol.iterator`, `Proxy`/`Reflect`, spread, destructuring) all run, and
microtasks drain.

**Not cleared: a production React build.** §12.4 item 1 sets that as the bar and
what runs today is a hand-written application. The gaps that will stop React
first, in order: no ES modules or `import`; `MutationObserver`,
`IntersectionObserver` and `ResizeObserver` report themselves missing rather
than working; `getBoundingClientRect` returns zeros and says so. Each is
recorded in the snapshot when a page asks for it, so the next attempt starts
from a list rather than a guess.

### 12.5 The gate that is not a milestone

`capabilities.javascript` flipping to `true` is a change to the box's threat
model, and it must be an explicit decision rather than the consequence of a
prototype working.

**What it spends.** Today the strongest security property this engine has is
that no JavaScript engine is linked into it at all, so page-borne prompt
injection has no delivery channel *by construction* rather than by filtering.
The moment script runs, that sentence must stop being used, and the
untrusted-content fence goes from a second line of defence to the only one.

**Site isolation is the one thing the box does not replace.** Chromium's process
model exists to contain a compromised renderer: filesystem, network privilege,
crash isolation, and cross-origin theft. The box covers the first three at a
stronger boundary than a renderer sandbox. It does not cover the fourth, because
it protects the host from the box and says nothing about origin A and origin B
sharing one address space. That did not matter while the engine held nothing
worth stealing. It matters now: the cookie jar shipped on 2026-08-08, and script
is what puts attacker-controlled input in the same process as it. Blitz and
Stylo being Rust is the current mitigation, and adding a JS engine written in C
or C++ is precisely what erodes it. Cheap options exist and one must be chosen
before this ships: one origin per session, clearing the jar across origins, or
keeping the jar out of the process that runs script.

**The gate is honoured so far.** `capabilities.javascript` reports the *running*
configuration, script is opt-in behind `--script`, and with it off a page's
`<script>` elements are inert exactly as they were. Nothing has flipped by
default, and nothing should until the rest of this subsection is answered.

**Limits belong to the box, not to the engine's good behaviour.** Reliable
in-engine interruption of a runaway script is hard; a wall-clock deadline and a
memory ceiling enforced from outside are not. `builtin_browser` currently sets
`mem_bytes` to 12GB and `max_procs` to 1024, both sized for a Chrome that spawns
renderer processes. An `h5i-light` box running script should die at a few
hundred megabytes.

**And the containment underneath is still the weaker story.** The mediator is
enforcement against a compliant agent, not containment against an evasive one
(7.2, §9). Running untrusted script inside that is the step that makes the
system less safe than it is today. The previous version of this section
concluded that this waits on the microVM tier. That conclusion has not been
refuted by anything above; it has been *outvoted* by the judgement that an agent
browser which cannot run script is not a product. Both halves of that sentence
should stay written down.

# The browser engine: the build log, B1 to B22

Sections B1 to B22, 2026-08-09 to 2026-08-28. `design-browser.md` carries
the engine's current state, the decisions that still govern it and the open
work. This is the
record of how it got there: the corpus runs, the WPT campaigns, the reference
engines that were read, and the reversals. Live code cites these numbers, so
they keep their identifiers.

## B1. Where it is, 2026-08-09

Built and verified end to end:

* **Render, snapshot, screenshot, receipts.** Blitz owns the DOM, Stylo the CSS,
  vello_cpu the raster. Every request is policy-checked and recorded *before* it
  moves: no receipt, no request.
* **A resident session.** `serve` holds a page several viewers and a control
  channel share. `session status|snapshot|navigate|scroll|type|submit|click`.
* **Cookies**, host-only and in memory, so a login works and nothing persists.
* **A fenced snapshot**, so page text reaches an agent labelled as data.
* **An action log**, box-claimed, so `h5i ui`'s agent-actions pane has a source.
* **JavaScript, as a limited preview.** Boa plus a bindings layer; events with
  capture and bubble; timers and microtasks on a virtual clock; `fetch` through
  the broker. Opt-in behind `--script`.

The sentence the whole design exists to produce, working today:

```
$ h5i-browser-light session click @e1
{"ok":true,"ref":"@e1","requests":["http://localhost:8231/api/item"],
 "settled":"settled after 0ms"}

200 navigation  /index.html
200 subresource /app.js      <- the script file, fetched before it ran
200 subresource /api/item    <- what the click caused
```

Not cleared: **a production React build**, which §12.4 sets as the
bar. What runs is a hand-written application of the right shape.

---

## B2. Architecture, and the constraints that chose it

Three decisions were made by the compiler or the dependency graph rather than by
preference. They are recorded because each one will look arbitrary later.

**One thread owns the page.** `Page` is not `Send`: Blitz's `BaseDocument` holds
an `Arc<dyn HtmlParserProvider>` and a `Box<dyn FontMetricsProvider>`, neither
thread-safe. There is no `Arc<Mutex<Session>>` to be had. So the page has a
single owning loop and everything else reaches it by channel. That is the right
shape for a multi-driver session anyway; here it was not optional.

**The Rust DOM is the single source of truth.** Every JS object naming a node is
a wrapper over a `NodeId`. A second tree inside the engine would let the
snapshot, the paint, the events and the script state drift apart, with nothing
downstream able to say which was right.

**The object model lives in a JavaScript prelude.** Listeners, timer callbacks
and promise resolvers are GC-managed; holding them Rust-side means tracing them
through Boa's collector. Putting them where Boa already owns their lifetime left
a Rust surface of about twenty primitives taking ids and strings, and turned
event propagation into ordinary code instead of a lifetime problem.

**The Boa pin is 0.19 and it is a workaround.** Boa 0.20+ requires
`icu_normalizer ~2.0`; `parley`, which Blitz pulls for text, requires `^2.1.1`.
Disjoint and semver-compatible, so Cargo must unify and cannot. 0.19 uses the
1.x line, semver-*incompatible* and therefore allowed to coexist, at the cost of
two ICU stacks in the build. Upstream Boa's `main` is already at `~2.2.0`, so
this unwinds on their next release. **Exit condition: Boa releases past that
change.**

---

## B3. Security: what script bought and what it cost

### B3.1 The loopback hole: **closed 2026-08-09**

`Policy::check` took only a URL, and loopback is allowed unconditionally by
default because the box's dev server is the point. Before script, an untrusted
page could *cause* a loopback request but not read the response. With `--script`
it could `fetch` the dev server, read the body, and POST it anywhere in
`net.egress`: a read primitive against the code the agent is working on, past
the egress proxy that never sees loopback.

Closed by `Policy::check_from(url, document)`: loopback is reachable **from a
loopback document**. A page served by the dev server may talk to it; a page from
the open web may not. Tested both directions
(`a_web_page_cannot_read_the_dev_server_and_never_reaches_the_wire`,
`the_dev_servers_own_page_still_reaches_it`).

Worth keeping in front of the reader: this was a **logic** bug, and Rust
prevents none of them. "Fewer memory bugs" is honest; "safer browser" is earned
by the origin model, not the language.

### B3.2 Site isolation is the one thing the box does not replace

Chromium's process model exists to contain a compromised renderer: filesystem,
network privilege, crash isolation, and cross-origin theft. The box covers the
first three at a stronger boundary than a renderer sandbox. It does not cover
the fourth. It protects the host from the box and says nothing about two
origins sharing one address space.

That did not matter while the engine held nothing worth stealing. The cookie jar
shipped on 2026-08-08 and script on 2026-08-09, so it mattered.

**Answered 2026-08-09, by the second of the three options**: the jar is cleared
on cross-origin navigation (`Jar::retain_origin`), so one session holds one
origin's cookies and a page can never be in the same address space as another
origin's session. The cost is stated where a user meets it: leaving an origin
drops its login, and the snapshot says so rather than letting the agent discover
it by being logged out. `document.cookie` additionally withholds `HttpOnly`,
which is the line between what the wire carries and what script may read.

### B3.3 The gate, still honoured

`capabilities.javascript` reports the *running* configuration; script is opt-in;
with it off, `<script>` elements are inert exactly as before. Nothing has
flipped by default and nothing should until 3.1 and 3.2 are answered. See
§12.5.

---

## B4. Three things that were wrong rather than missing: **all fixed**

"Missing" is honest and reports itself. These were worse: they corrupted a page
while looking like they worked, which is the failure mode the fence and the
unsupported-API log exist to prevent, and they polluted every measurement taken
before they were fixed. Kept here because the *class* is the lesson, not the
three bugs.

1. ~~`innerHTML` getter returned `textContent`~~: all markup stripped, so
   `el.innerHTML = el.innerHTML` destroyed the subtree. Now a real serialisation.
   The root cause was upstream of the getter: `DocumentConfig` never set an
   `html_parser_provider`, so `set_inner_html` silently did nothing.
2. ~~`createDocumentFragment()` returned a `<div>`~~: appending a fragment
   injected a real element that broke `.parent > .child` and layout. Now a real
   fragment, and one that can be searched (§B8.6).
3. ~~`Element.style` did not exist~~: `el.style.display = 'none'` threw and
   killed the script at that line. Now a real `StyleDeclaration`.

The same class keeps recurring and is worth naming: **a plausible answer is
worse than no answer.** `matchMedia` returning false to everything, `scrollTop`
computed from the bounding rect, `structuredClone` via a JSON round trip, and
`clientHeight` for `documentElement` were all this bug wearing different clothes.

---

## B5. The bindings backlog

Ordered by what blocks real applications first. Cross-referenced against
Thalora's surface (§B7) where that project has already mapped the ground, and
marked **cheap** where Blitz or Stylo already holds the answer and we are merely
refusing to give it.

### Tier A: blocks nearly everything modern

| | why | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ~~ES modules and `import()`~~ | every production bundle ships `<script type="module">` | **built**, through the broker; bare specifiers are refused rather than rewritten to a CDN |
| ~~`Element.style` (CSSOM)~~ | `el.style.display = 'none'` is ubiquitous | **built** |
| ~~`getBoundingClientRect`~~ | every popover, dropdown, drag and virtual list | **built**: Blitz computes `final_layout` already |
| ~~`getComputedStyle`~~ | feature detection and measurement | **built**, via Stylo's `to_css_string`, not `Debug` |
| ~~`MutationObserver`~~ | frameworks depend on it | **built**. The semantic delta went its own way in the end: diffing two outlines, not observing mutations (§B8.7) |
| ~~`IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`~~ | lazy loading, virtual lists, responsive components | **built 2026-08-09**, driven from the settle loop (§B8.2) |
| ~~`localStorage` / `sessionStorage`~~ | absence throws or breaks init paths | **built**, deliberately non-persistent; see §B6 |
| ~~`history.pushState`~~ | SPA routing | **built**, and it moves `location` with it. For a while it did not, so a router reading its own route back got the page it had already left |

### Tier B: blocks a large fraction of real applications

All built, most of it driven by §B8 rather than by this list:

* Real event types: `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, `InputEvent`, `CustomEvent`
  with `detail`, plus `on*` handler properties.
* Form semantics: `input`/`change` on typing, checkbox, radio, `select` with a
  live `selectedIndex`, `FormData`.
* `closest()`, `matches()`, `dataset`, `cloneNode`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, a real
  `DOMTokenList` over whichever attribute holds the tokens.
* `AbortController`, `Headers`, `Request`, and **concurrent `fetch`**: six on
  the wire at once, so an SPA's fan-out is no longer a waterfall of our making.
* `window.scrollTo`, `scrollY`, and the viewport dimensions, which nothing had
  ever exposed.

### Tier C: the tail

Built since, because a real page asked: **custom elements** (define, upgrade
existing markup, the lifecycle callbacks), `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`,
`structuredClone`, `crypto.getRandomValues` and `randomUUID` over the OS CSPRNG,
`XMLHttpRequest` over the same queue `fetch` uses.

Still absent, and still unscheduled: Canvas 2D, WebSocket, Workers,
**WebAssembly**, Shadow DOM, SVG DOM, Streams. Shadow DOM is the interesting
one. The application corpus includes two design-system sites that use it, and
neither asked for it, because their documentation pages are server-rendered.
That is the rule working: nothing here is added until a page in §B8 needs it.

---

## B6. What this browser deliberately is not

A disposable sandbox removes most of a browser's surface as a *requirement*, not
as a compromise. None of the following is planned, and each should be refused in
review rather than re-argued:

**Never**: tabs, bookmarks, history UI, downloads manager, password saving,
autofill, extensions, sync, printing, DRM/EME, WebRTC, WebTransport, WebGPU,
WebXR, Bluetooth/USB/Serial/HID/MIDI, camera, microphone, geolocation, sensors,
desktop notifications, push, background sync, Service Workers, Cache Storage,
File System Access, popups, multiple windows, picture-in-picture, fullscreen,
XSLT, FTP.

**Simplified rather than absent**, and always in memory:

* cookies: session lifetime only, destroyed with the process
* `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`: small maps, never a file
* history: the current page and a short navigation list
* clipboard: a sandbox-local buffer, never the host's
* dialogs: `alert` to the console, `confirm` from policy, `prompt` refused
* downloads: handed up to h5i as a response, never written as a file

**Not cut, because cutting them makes this a static HTML renderer rather than a
browser**: DOM mutation and query, CSS cascade with flex/grid/position/overflow,
click/input/change/submit/focus/keyboard, promises and microtasks and timers,
`fetch` with redirects and TLS, **ES modules**, forms, images, web fonts,
navigation, the rendered result, and console plus exception capture.

**No iframes.** Not "same-origin only": none. Each iframe is a second document,
a second script realm and a navigation boundary. It is not a feature, it is a
second browser.

---

## B7. Thalora: read it, do not adopt it

`Brainwires/thalora-web-browser` (MIT, 216k lines of Rust, Boa-based, built for
agents) is the same thesis and worth reading closely. It is proof that this much
*can* be built on Boa. It is not evidence that this architecture gets you there
faster, and three of its choices are worth studying specifically as things not
to repeat.

### B7.1 Why it cannot be a dependency

1. **It is built on Boa's internals, not Boa's public API.** Its `Document` uses
   `IntrinsicObject`, `BuiltInBuilder` and `StandardConstructors`, which upstream
   Boa declares `pub(crate)`. That is why `engines/boa` is a submodule pointing
   at their own fork. Using their bindings means owning a fork of a JavaScript
   engine and its security updates.
2. **Its DOM is its own**: `html5ever` plus `taffy`, state in
   `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<..>>>`. Our bindings sit on Blitz's `BaseDocument`, which
   is also what Stylo styles and what we paint. Porting means rewriting the body
   of every binding; only the shape transfers.
3. **It does not paint.** No rasteriser, no screenshot: `taffy` is layout only.
   The visual half, which is what makes `h5i ui` possible and separates us from
   Lightpanda, is not in there.

It also uses hand-rolled CSS over `taffy` where we get **Stylo**, Firefox's
production cascade, through Blitz. Moving toward their stack would be a
compatibility downgrade.

### B7.2 Three cautionary findings, checked against the source

**It has the dual-DOM problem this design exists to avoid.** JavaScript mutates
Boa-side element data; layout runs over a *separately re-parsed* tree:
`renderer/layout_bridge.rs:212` calls `scraper::Html::parse`, and the CSS path
builder walks scraper's `ElementRef`. So the DOM script sees and the DOM that is
laid out are not one tree, synchronised through serialised HTML. That is exactly
the drift §B2 refuses, and it is the strongest available argument for the
`NodeId`-wrapper rule: mutations must apply to the Blitz DOM directly, never via
an HTML string.

**Its module loader bypasses its own network layer, and invents a CDN.**
`module_loader.rs:129` builds a private `reqwest::blocking::Client`, so module
fetches never pass whatever policy the rest of the browser applies. Worse,
`module_loader.rs:103` maps bare specifiers to a CDN:

```rust
Ok(format!("https://esm.sh/{}", specifier))
```

`import "lodash"` silently becomes a request to `esm.sh`. That is not a web
standard, and in a sandbox it is an unrequested external dependency introduced
by the engine itself. **When we build ES modules (§B5 Tier A), every module fetch
goes through the same broker as HTML, `fetch`, images and fonts, and a bare
specifier that does not resolve is an error the agent reads, not a silent trip
to a third party.**

**It reports a thrown exception as success.** `renderer/execution.rs:256`, after
printing the error:

```rust
Ok("undefined".to_string()) // Return success with undefined result
```

This is the failure mode this whole engine is organised against: silent-wrong is
worse than missing. Our equivalent path returns the error, surfaces it in the
page console, and the snapshot says when a page did not finish. Their README's
"Chrome 131 compatibility" and "Zero Mock Implementations" should not be read as
real-site compatibility evidence; the WASM-target stubs are honestly labelled,
but `browser/selection.rs` returns a literal `"selected text"` placeholder, and
the line above turns a broken page into a passing one.

### B7.3 What it is genuinely worth

Its module inventory is the best available map of which Web APIs an agent
browser needs, written by someone who did the work: `dom/` is 25k lines,
`events/` 7.6k, `storage/` 12k, with a file per API. §B5 cites it per row for
exactly that reason.

The right way to use it: **extract the backlog and the test cases, not the
code.** For each API we take from their list, find the matching Web Platform
Test and make that our test, so our compatibility claim rests on the standard
rather than on their implementation. Their Boa binding *patterns* are worth
reading; their DOM, network and renderer architecture is not worth adopting.

## B8. Measure, then build

Which APIs matter cannot be answered from a chair, and the instrument already
exists: every unsupported call is counted and surfaced in the snapshot.

**The corpus run.** Point the engine at fifty real sites with `--script`,
collect the ranked counts, and let the priority order write itself:

```
note: this page used Web APIs this engine does not have
      (Element.style x41, MutationObserver x6, closest x4)
```

An afternoon, and it turns §B5 from a considered guess into a table. It must
happen *after* §B4, or the results measure our own bugs.

Where the corpus and Thalora's inventory agree, build it. Where they disagree,
the corpus wins: it is this decade's web, not a specification of it.

### B8.1 First run, 2026-08-09

28 sites: docs, references, wikis, standards, package pages, news, and a few
script-heavy ones so the failures would be honest.

```
27/28 loaded; 23 gave a usable outline (>=5 lines)
 0 rendered materially more *with* script
 0 failed to settle within budget

api                      sites  calls        console errors
matchMedia                   4      5        17  could not load https (cross-origin, denied)
document.cookie              3      7        13  TypeError
IntersectionObserver         1      1         6  ReferenceError
setInterval                  1      1
```

**It found three bugs before it found any missing APIs**, which is the argument
for running it at all:

* `<script type="application/json">` was being **executed**. Every `<script>`
  ran regardless of `type`, so pages embedding state as JSON, github.com among
  them, had it parsed as JavaScript, filling the console with syntax errors that
  blamed the page.
* **HTTP errors were rendered as the page.** crates.io answered 404, the engine
  rendered the error body, and the outline came back empty with nothing anywhere
  saying why. The status was in the request log and nowhere an agent looks.
* **Missing APIs did not name themselves.** A global we never defined threw a
  bare `ReferenceError`; a method on a half-defined object threw
  `TypeError: not a callable function`. Neither reached the unsupported list, so
  the measurement could not see them: the method depends on missing things
  reporting themselves, and they were not.

**The headline result: for the pages agents actually read, script adds nothing
to the outline.** Not one of 28 sites rendered materially more with `--script`
than without. Docs, references and wikis are server-rendered; script adds
interactivity, not content. That is a real finding about the workload and it
argues the reading case was close to solved before any of this.

Two caveats keep it from being stronger than it is. The harness allows only the
page's own host and a few common CDNs, so **17 cross-origin scripts were denied
by policy** and those bundles never ran, so the script-heavy end of the corpus is
therefore under-tested. And the remaining 13 TypeErrors and 6 ReferenceErrors are
still anonymous: they come from pages touching DOM properties we return
null/undefined for, which the `missingApi` list does not cover because they are
not globals.

**What the corpus asks for next**, in its own order: `matchMedia` (answered now,
still recorded), `document.cookie`, `IntersectionObserver`, `setInterval`.

`document.cookie` is the interesting one, because it looked like a deliberate
refusal and turned out to be a false choice. See §B8.2.

### B8.2 Second run, same day: the list is empty, and that is not the same as done

All four were built, and the corpus now asks for nothing:

```
27/28 loaded; 23 gave a usable outline
 0 rendered materially more *with* script
 0 failed to settle

api                      sites  calls        console errors
(nothing)                                    17  could not load https (cross-origin, denied)
                                             13  TypeError
                                              6  ReferenceError
```

**An empty unsupported list beside 19 anonymous errors is a misleading result,
and it is the honest state of things.** Those errors come from pages touching
DOM *properties* that return null or undefined, not from globals, so
`missingApi`, which covers globals, cannot name them. The instrument now
reports nothing because it cannot see what is left, which is a different fact
from there being nothing left. Naming those is the next measurement problem, and
it has to be solved before another run means much.

### B8.3 Fixing the instrument, which was the actual next task

Two blind spots, closed:

* **Unknown properties on objects we own.** `wrap()` and `document` now return a
  `Proxy` whose `get` records a name that is on neither the prototype chain nor
  the object itself. A property we implement takes the plain path, and so does
  an expando the page assigned and reads back, so **a working page records
  nothing at all**: the list stays a list of gaps rather than a log of traffic.
* **Undeclared globals.** No proxy can trap `Sentry.init(...)`: it throws before
  any object is consulted. The thrown `ReferenceError` carries the name, so
  `note_error` reads it back. Only identifier-shaped names are accepted, because
  the list is read by an agent and a page must not get to write into it by
  throwing a chosen string.

The run immediately after named 15 properties where there had been fog, and a
second pass named five globals. Answering both rounds moved the errors:

| | before | naming fix | answered |
|---|---|---|---|
| named asks | 0 | 15 | 14 |
| `TypeError` | 13 | 13 | 10 |
| `ReferenceError` | 6 | 6 | 3 |

**`TypeError` went 8 → 10 partway through, and that was progress.** Exposing
`HTMLElement` let `class X extends HTMLElement` get *further* before failing, at
`customElements.define`, which the list now names. A count going up because
pages reach deeper is the shape of a real measurement.

Two things the remaining list should not be misread as:

* **`$` is not an engine gap.** It is jQuery, from a CDN the corpus policy
  denied. The page is right to fail; the fix is a policy decision about asset
  hosts, not a binding.
* **The residual `TypeError`s are mostly selector misses**: `querySelector`
  returning null for markup that genuinely is not there. That is correct
  behaviour, reported honestly, and no amount of API work removes it. Naming
  *where* it happened needs source positions from Boa, which is a separate job.

### B8.4 Answering the named list, and what it caught in the answers

Everything §B8.3 surfaced is built. In order of what they were worth:

* **Custom elements, for real.** `define` upgrades the markup already on the
  page, delivers the initial values of `observedAttributes`, and runs
  `connectedCallback` once the node is genuinely in the tree. Defining without
  upgrading would have been the worse kind of half-support: a page that renders
  its markup server-side and defines its components in a deferred bundle, which is most
  of them, would register everything, see no error, and render nothing. The id
  reaches the constructor out of band through a construction slot, because
  `super()` takes no arguments and the class never sees the node it is
  attaching to.
* **Real comment nodes**, so a template library's anchor stays out of the
  outline an agent reads instead of appearing as stray text.
* **`scrollTop`/`scrollHeight`/`clientHeight`** answering from the document
  rather than from the element's own box, since `scrollTop + clientHeight >=
  scrollHeight` is how every bottom-of-page check is written and it has to be
  *true at the bottom*. `clientHeight` already existed, computed from the
  bounding rect, which for `documentElement` is the page height rather than the
  window, so the idiom read "already at the bottom" everywhere.
* **`window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight`/`scrollY`** and the scroll methods, which
  nothing had ever exposed. This one the instrument could not have found:
  nothing wraps the global object, so they were simply undefined, and a layout
  that measures instead of asking `matchMedia` got `NaN` out of its own
  arithmetic. Found while chasing an unrelated scroll bug.
* `compareDocumentPosition`, `contains`, `getRootNode`, `isConnected`,
  `defaultValue`, `getElementsByTagName`, `getElementsByName`, `importNode`,
  `createNodeIterator`/`createTreeWalker`, and `implementation`, which names
  `createHTMLDocument` as refused rather than handing back a broken document,
  because a second document really is out of reach when there is one tree.

**The run after that caught three bugs in the answers themselves**, which is the
argument for the instrument in one line:

| reported | what it actually was |
|---|---|
| `Element._h5iConnected` | *our own* bookkeeping flag, stored on the node, read before it was set |
| `Element.tagName` | a page reading `tagName` off a **text** node; every node was labelled "Element" |
| `$`, still | jQuery that *loaded and threw*, not one that was refused |

All three are fixed: the flag moved off the nodes, labels follow the node's
actual type, and a script that throws is recorded as not-run alongside one that
was refused: its globals are undefined either way.

That left one ask, `Text.tagName`, and it was a false positive worth a rule:
**a gap is only a gap if a real browser would have answered.** An element
property read off a text node returns undefined in every engine there is, so
claiming it would have sent us building something that does not exist. The
proxy now stays quiet in exactly that case, and `document.namespaceURI` and
`ownerDocument` are defined-as-undefined and null for the same reason.

### B8.5 Where the corpus stands

```
27/28 loaded; 23 gave a usable outline; 0 failed to settle
asks: (none)
errors: 33, of which 0 are anonymous
        17  cross-origin subresources the corpus policy denied
         3  "`$` is missing because a script this page needed did not run: ..."
        13  page errors, each prefixed with the script it came from
```

**Zero anonymous errors is the number that matters**, not the empty ask list.
Every remaining line names either a request we refused or the script that
threw. Boa 0.19 gives neither a line number nor a stack, so the script element
is the finest locus available; a real position needs engine support we do not
have, and that is now the only thing in the way of an agent debugging a page it
is reading.

One page also rendered materially more *with* script for the first time: the
Rust book, 35 lines to 171, which is the first evidence in this file that
running script buys an agent anything at all on a real documentation site.

What the four turned into:

* **`matchMedia` answers from the real viewport.** Returning `false` to
  everything is not neutral: a responsive layout asks and then commits to the
  branch it was told, so a wrong answer is a wrong page rather than a missing
  feature. `min-width`, `max-width`, `orientation` and `prefers-color-scheme`
  have correct answers at a fixed viewport with a known scheme; a feature
  outside that set still records itself.
* **`document.cookie` exists, and honours `HttpOnly`.** The earlier framing,
  that exposing it would break "an agent can be logged in without reading the
  credential", was a false choice, because a browser has the same problem and
  solved it: a session cookie is almost always `HttpOnly`, and that flag is
  exactly the line between what the wire carries and what script may see. The
  jar had been parsing `HttpOnly` and dropping it, which was harmless until
  script existed and is not now. Page script sees the non-`HttpOnly` cookies;
  the session stays out of reach.
* **`setInterval` repeats**, and deliberately does *not* hold the page open.
  Waiting for a perpetual timer to drain would mean a page with a clock, a
  carousel or an autosave could never be described as settled, and every
  snapshot of it would carry a "still busy" note that told an agent nothing.
  Virtual time advances only as far as pending one-shot work requires, and
  intervals fire along the way.
* **`IntersectionObserver` and `ResizeObserver`** are driven from the settle
  loop rather than a frame clock, because this engine has no frames at rest and
  an observer waiting for a repaint would never fire at all. Intersection
  reports edges rather than every settle, so a page that lazy-loads on entry is
  told once.

---

### B8.6 A second corpus: applications, not documents

The document corpus reached zero asks and zero anonymous errors, and then
stopped being informative, **because four of its 28 pages still rendered
nothing and not one of them was a missing API**:

| site | why | not |
|---|---|---|
| crates.io | server answered **404** to a request that sent no `Accept` | an API gap |
| stackoverflow | **403** bot wall, rendering as one line | an API gap |
| json.org | a `<meta refresh>` this engine never followed | an API gap |
| vitejs.dev | redirected to vite.dev, correctly refused, unhelpfully explained | an API gap |

That inverted the plan: the next frontier was the network layer and the honesty
of the report around it, not more bindings. All four are fixed (§B8.8), and
crates.io answers 200 and json.org renders 299 lines instead of 1.

So the corpus was **pointed at applications instead** (SPAs, interactive demos,
design systems) because a documentation corpus will never ask for routing,
storage or template cloning when it contains nothing that does them. It named,
immediately and specifically:

* **`<template>.content`**, and this was not a small gap. Its absence made
  `template.content.cloneNode(true)` throw `cannot convert 'null' or 'undefined'
  to object`, which was the *entire text* of **fifteen module failures**. Clone,
  query, fill, append is how every framework renders a row.
* **Scoped selector queries that do not scope.** `query_selector_all` always
  starts at the document root and the engine narrowed by ancestry afterwards, so
  a **detached** subtree was invisible, which is every cloned template before it
  is inserted, exactly when a framework searches one. Stylo's fast path consults
  the document's id and class caches and reports "handled, nothing found" rather
  than falling through, so scoped queries now walk the subtree and match element
  by element. `matches()` had the same bug and answered false for anything
  detached.
* **`location.pathname`**, which was undefined, and `pushState`, which never
  moved the address at all.
* `relList`, `attributes`, `firstElementChild`, `getAnimations`,
  `document.contentType`, `meta.content`, `on*` handlers.

### B8.7 What the instrument caught in its own reflection, twice more

* **A framework's private field is not an API gap.** Solid reads
  `document._$DX_DELEGATE` before setting it, and the ask list carried it as
  something this engine was missing. No web platform property begins with `_` or
  `$`.
* **"module failed" names nothing**: the same anonymity §B8.3 removed from
  script errors, one level up. Modules now carry their specifier into the
  failure. The reporting proxy also watches `location`, `history`, `navigator`,
  `performance`, the storages and `crypto`, which is where the last unnamed
  failures were hiding.

**The corpus now lives in the repository**, after a crash took the only copy
along with the scratchpad it sat in. `corpus/run.py` is the network instrument;
`tests/corpus.rs` is the part CI runs: the same patterns against local
fixtures, asserting the two properties that matter, and it found two real bugs
the moment it was written.

Applications corpus: 20/20 load, one ask left, **zero anonymous errors**.
Fourteen module failures remain, each now attributed to a named bundle. Going
further needs source positions, which is the concrete cost of the Boa
constraint below and the clearest argument for revisiting it.

### B8.8 The network layer

Not bindings, and the reason four pages read as empty:

* **Request fidelity.** No `Accept`, no `Accept-Language`, and a user agent that
  named only the crate. The agent string is honest rather than imitative. It
  names this engine and does not claim to be Chrome, and is now one constant
  shared with `navigator.userAgent`, because a page that branches on it
  server-side and again in script must see the same string twice.
* **`<meta refresh>`** is followed, with a hop limit and a visited set, and a
  refresh further out than 15 seconds is *reported* rather than followed: that is
  a page updating itself, not a redirect.
* **A refused redirect names its target.** Following it automatically would let
  a server route us out of the allowlist; saying where it wanted to go costs
  nothing.
* **Bot challenges are named**, because a challenge page renders to almost
  nothing and its outline is otherwise indistinguishable from an empty page.
* **`fetch` is concurrent**: six on the wire at once, the browsers' per-host
  figure, chosen so a page with two hundred images cannot become two hundred
  threads inside a box with a memory ceiling. Waiting on the wire uses *real*
  time against its own budget, since the virtual clock is free to advance and a
  round trip is not.

### B8.9 What it costs, measured

`cargo run --release --example perf`. Numbers from one WSL2 laptop, and it
drifts by 10% between runs, so read the ratios rather than the digits.

**First, a correction to what this section used to say.** Its `script` column
counted the realm twice. A script-enabled factory runs the page's scripts inside
`from_html`, through `finish_page`, and the benchmark then called `run_scripts`
again — which does not no-op, it builds a second realm and runs every script a
second time. At 15.9 ms a realm the error looked like noise; at 58 ms it was
most of the number, which is how it was finally caught. Only the benchmark was
affected: `finish_page` is the sole caller in the product.

**The realm went from 63 ms to 21 ms a page**, and it is no longer most of a
small page: 87% of the ten-section row before, about 60% now. What moved is the
prelude's parse and compile, paid by every page for a source that never changes
and now paid once per thread. §B15.12a records why that was refused for as long
as it was and what changed.

Read the phase table as a within-run comparison and nothing more. The two
columns come from one run on one thread, which is what makes them comparable;
across three runs the first-realm total was 83.0, 101.3 and 79.8 ms and the
later-realm total 15.4, 20.1 and 16.1 ms. The ratio holds at about five to one
and the saving at 60–80 ms, but no single digit in that table is worth quoting
on its own, and the older 63 ms figure was measured on a quieter day than the
83 ms one beside it.

Two things in the phase table are worth reading rather than skipping. **The
compile does not shrink, it relocates**: the first realm on a thread still pays
all 67 ms, so a one-shot `h5i browser read` is helped only by what overlaps it,
while a session serving many navigations pays it once. And **a later realm's
context costs ~3 ms against the first realm's ~400 µs**, reproducibly across all
three runs — it builds its intrinsics against a GC heap that already holds the
template and a previous realm. How much of that the template is responsible for
is not known: a second realm in a process was probably always dearer than the
first, and there was no phase column to show it before. It is 3 ms against 67
either way, which is why it was recorded rather than chased.

The per-read and per-call rows were re-measured and left alone. They moved
between runs by as much as 25% on this box in either direction, which is wider
than the 10% this section claims and wide enough that nothing below the page
level should be read as having changed.

Code, not bytes: blanking all 164 KiB of comments in a 443 KiB prelude changed
parse time by **nothing measurable**. The documentation is free; only what the
parser tokenises is not. `the_eagerly_parsed_prelude_stays_within_its_budget`
holds the line at 275 KiB, because the file grew 4,692 lines in two commits
during a coverage push and took the realm from 15.9 ms to 82.8 ms with nothing
saying so — every test passed, since a slower engine is not a wrong one. What a
KiB costs has fallen with the compile: about 45 µs per page to *run*, plus
245 µs on the first page of a thread to compile, against ~150 µs per page before.

#### What came out, and what each was worth

1. **The WebIDL member decoration is a tier.** `idlharness` checks that every
   interface member is enumerable and that an accessor reached on a prototype
   throws; no page asks either. Rebuilding every descriptor of every interface
   prototype cost **15 ms of 83**, on every page, and it now lives in a source
   Boa is handed only under `--webidl-conformance`, which `wpt/run.py` passes.
2. **The gap reporting moved to the end of the prototype chain.** It was a
   `Proxy` in front of every wrapper, so it fired on reads that found what they
   asked for: **799 ns of the 882 ns** a known property cost, against 82 ns for
   a plain object. A read that misses already walks the whole chain, so the
   sentinel sits where only a miss arrives. Known reads went to ~200 ns, and a
   compromise went with it — the proxy passed the raw target as receiver to
   avoid double-trapping, which made a miss inside a page's own getter
   invisible.
3. **The engine stopped paying a trap to ask itself a question.** `get tagName()`
   reads `this._nsuri` to learn whether the element came from `createElementNS`,
   and for everything the parser made it never did — so the most-read accessor
   in the engine walked its whole prototype chain into a proxy, 1415 ns against
   the 196 ns its native call costs. `declareInternals` answers at the first
   hop, and `an_internal_read_never_reaches_the_sentinel` is the guard for the
   next such field.
4. **Every settle stopped waiting on a sleeping thread.** The deadline watchdog
   polled a flag every 20 ms and was *joined*, so a settle that finished in
   50 µs sat in `join` until the thread woke. A 20 ms tax on every settle and
   every agent `wait`, spent asleep, and intermittent — a race between the body
   finishing and the watchdog reaching its first sleep, so half the runs looked
   fine. A condition variable, and the deadline is unchanged.

Three tiers exist so far (`conformance`, `sockets`, `has`, 12 KiB together) and
the mechanism is cheap to extend, but its ceiling is low: 272 of the 284 KiB of
code is DOM core that every page uses. The one tier still worth building is the
form-control extras, ~48 KiB and ~7 ms, which needs the free-variable analysis
that splitting a shared closure demands.

#### Measured and rejected, so nobody tries again

* **Precomputing the known property names**, so the old proxy trap did a hash
  lookup instead of walking the prototype chain: no change. The cost was Boa
  dispatching into a JavaScript trap at all, which is why the answer in the end
  was to stop standing in front of the object.
* **Raising the loop bound from 5 to 50 million**: turned a site that returned
  in three minutes into one that had not returned in four.
* **Interning the uppercased tag names**, and building the attribute answer
  without its two intermediate `String`s: no change either. A native call costs
  ~136 ns of dispatch before it does anything at all, so shaving the work at the
  far end of it is shaving the small half. The allocations went anyway; the
  cache did not, because it was state for nothing. What worked was not making
  the call: `tagName` is remembered on the wrapper, 740 ns to 300 ns.
* **Stripping comments before handing the source to Boa**: no change, per the
  measurement above. Worth recording because the idea is obvious and the file is
  a third comments by volume.
* **Reusing the compiled prelude across pages**, which would remove the 42 ms of
  parse and compile and is the only 3x-class win left. A `CodeBlock` owns its
  `InlineCache` entries, and those hold live shape-to-slot mappings, so reusing
  one carries the last page's object shapes into the next page's lookups. That
  is a sharper reason than the interner one this section used to give, and it
  names the upstream change that would unblock it: reset the caches on reuse, or
  hang them off the realm rather than the code block.

Reusing the *realm* across navigations is refused on other grounds and still is:
a page could leave state for whatever loads next, which is the same reason the
cookie jar is cleared across origins.

#### The history this replaces

The Boa revision bump, measured before and after, and still the strongest
argument for pinning a revision over a five-month-old release:

```
a DOM property read              on 0.19      on main
  plain object, no proxy            775 ns       92 ns
  watched node, known property     2460 ns      706 ns
  watched node, read from tree     6173 ns     1534 ns
```

Three earlier changes, each of which still holds:

1. **A page with no script no longer builds a realm.** A page with nothing to
   run was paying the whole fixed cost for a realm never asked a question. It is
   also reported correctly: "had none to run" is a different fact from "script
   is off", and a page with no script is *settled* rather than unknown.
2. **Collections are no longer watched.** Wrapping a query result in the
   reporting proxy cost **3.9x on iteration**, because every index read went
   through a trap and `for (const el of query)` is the hottest line in DOM code.
3. **`matches()` is a direct predicate.** It had been asking the *parent* for all
   matching descendants and checking membership, which made `closest()` walk a
   subtree per ancestor: quadratic on any page whose framework calls it in a
   render loop.

### B8.10 Source positions, and what they found

Boa 0.21 maps a program counter back to a source position. It is pinned by
**revision of upstream `main`**, not by release: the 0.21.1 release pins three
icu crates to `~2.0.0`, which excludes what parley requires, and parley arrives
through blitz. Upstream relaxed those pins after the release, so a pinned commit
needs no fork and no patched source, and buys five months of engine and parser
fixes over a five-month-old tag, which turned out to matter.

Two other routes were tried and rejected with evidence. **Vendoring** the two
crates worked and cost 7.5 MB and 508 files for a two-line change. **Forking**
at `v0.21.1` plus one commit also worked, and is one commit, one file, six
lines, but it is a fork to carry, and upstream `main` had already made the same
change for free.

Errors now read:

```
inline script #2: TypeError: cannot convert 'null' or 'undefined' to object
    at inner (inline script #2:2:18)
    at outer (inline script #2:3:32)
    at <main> (inline script #2:4:6)
```

The *path* mattered as much as the line: a source built from bytes carries none,
so every frame said `unknown at :2:18`, and a line number without a file is
barely better than nothing when a page has nine scripts.

**Module failures: 14 → 4.** The positions named every cause within an hour:

| named cause | fix |
| --- | --- |
| `EventTarget is not defined` | a real base class, independent of the tree; a store is not a node |
| `HTMLAnchorElement`, `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLTemplateElement`, … | the per-tag constructor family, all aliasing `Element` |
| `Invalid URL: /assets/…` | `import.meta.url`, which bundlers resolve every sibling asset against |
| `RuntimeLimit: exceeded recursive calls` | Boa's 512-frame default, which Next.js exceeded while merely initialising |
| `DOMParser is not defined` | parse-to-subtree, with no script inside it running |
| `not a callable function` | collections that were not collections; see below |

That last one was the instrument's blind spot again, and the most instructive.
The reporting proxy watched `document` and nodes but **not the collections and
token lists this engine builds itself**, so `querySelectorAll(...).item(0)` was
undefined and calling it produced exactly that unnamed error. Collections and
`DOMTokenList` are now watched, and immediately named their own gaps:
`createElementNS` (every framework that draws an SVG icon), `after`/`before`/
`replaceWith`/`replaceChildren`, `toggleAttribute`, `localName`, the namespaced
attribute methods, `createRange` and `elementFromPoint`.

`StyleDeclaration` is deliberately *not* watched: it answers any CSS property by
design, so it has no name it is missing, and wrapping one proxy in another
defeats the `in` check the reporting one depends on.

### B8.11 Three things that are not ours, stated plainly

1. **A Boa parser bug**, and it was worth doubting before reporting. The first
   version of this note blamed a comment; the second blamed modules. Both were
   wrong, and testing the doubt produced a far sharper bug:

   ```js
   var   a = 1
   , b = 2;        // parses
   let   a = 1
   , b = 2;        // SyntaxError: unexpected token ','
   const a = 1
   , b = 2;        // SyntaxError
   let   a
   , b;            // SyntaxError
   ```

   All four are valid JavaScript: node runs them, as script and as module. The
   asymmetry is the finding: **`var` handles it and `let`/`const` do not**, so
   this is a defect in the lexical-declaration path rather than a deliberate
   choice about semicolon insertion. Per the grammar a `,` continues a
   `BindingList`, so it is not an offending token and no semicolon may be
   inserted.

   Confirmed with this engine entirely out of the path: `Context::default()`,
   `Source::from_bytes`, no host, no module loader, no HTML, so it is not ours.
   Minified bundles that keep `/*! @license */` comments between declarators
   produce exactly this shape, which is how lit.dev fails.

   Not fixable here, and not worth working around: rewriting a page's own source
   would move every line number we just gained and could corrupt string
   literals, the plausible-wrong answer again. What *is* ours is that the
   failure names the script it came from and does not take the rest of the page
   with it, which `a_script_the_parser_cannot_read_is_named_and_does_not_take_the_page_with_it`
   pins.
2. **Two sites exceed any reasonable timeout** (lit.dev, material-web), and the
   cause is that they now get *further*. `DOMParser` unlocked execution that used
   to fail early, and removing the lying feature-detection stubs sent pages down
   polyfill paths they had previously skipped. lit.dev went from failing in
   seconds to **seven minutes** of real work.

   Two bounds were added and the second one works, for one of the two shapes a
   slow page has:

   * **Many jobs.** Boa's job executor checks a cancellation token between jobs,
     and `get_cancellation_token` hands it out as an `Arc<AtomicBool>`, so a
     watchdog thread can set it, which is the only wall-clock lever the engine
     offers. A page building 200,000 promise jobs is now stopped at 15 seconds,
     renders what it had, and says so in the engine's own voice. This is the
     shape a promise-driven page actually has.
   * **One long job.** lit.dev looked like the other shape: a module graph
     evaluating depth-first inside a *single* job, beyond any token check.

   **That second diagnosis was wrong, and wrong in the most useful direction.**
   The page was not pathological; *this engine* was slow enough to make it look
   that way. `appendChild` into the document cost 40 µs against 13 µs for a
   detached one, because every insertion walked to the root to ask whether it
   was connected and then walked the inserted subtree looking for custom
   elements, on pages that had defined none. An early return when nothing is
   defined, and a native `isConnected` that walks in Rust instead of one call
   per ancestor, took it to **7 µs, the same as the detached case**.

   lit.dev went from three and a half minutes to fifty seconds, material-web
   from a timeout to forty-five, and both now *return*. A second pass on the
   mutation-record path: the old value of an attribute was read from the tree,
   and a record object with two arrays allocated, on every write, whether or not
   anything was observing, took the hot operations to:

   ```
   createElement    5.5 µs      textContent  2.0 µs
   setAttribute     4.0 µs      appendChild  4.0 µs
   ```

   from 7 / 8.5 / 18 / 40.5 µs before either pass.

   **And then the sites did not get faster**, which is the part worth writing
   down. lit.dev renders in 0.27s without script and 46s with it, of which 0.5s
   is network; the DOM is no longer where the time goes. Nor are the budgets: a
   shared deadline across the script phase and the settle, which used to add up,
   changed nothing either, because the time is inside a *single* evaluation
   that neither a between-jobs token nor a between-scripts budget can interrupt.

   So the original diagnosis was half right and recorded too confidently in both
   directions. The engine was slow enough to turn a heavy page into a hang, and
   fixing that was worth four times on the hot path; what is left really is one
   uninterruptible unit of work, and bounding it needs an interrupt inside the
   interpreter loop. That is still upstream, and it is now the only thing
   standing between this engine and a page like lit.dev.
3. **Total CPU is unbounded.** Boa exposes no wall-clock interrupt, so the
   engine bounds what it can (one loop, recursion depth, stack size) and a
   caller that cannot wait must impose its own timeout. Raising the loop bound
   from 5 to 50 million turned a site that returned in three minutes into one
   that had not returned in four; the bound stays low enough to return, and
   trips are reported so a thin outline is explained rather than mysterious.

Both limits had to move together: raising the frame count alone changed nothing,
because the *stack size* was what a deep call actually hit.

### B8.12 A page's own errors, made legible

`console.error(someError)` rendered as `{}`, because an Error has no enumerable
own properties and the console used `JSON.stringify`. remix.run produced **1487
lines saying exactly that**, and the message, the one part an agent needed,
was what got thrown away. Errors now render as name, message and trace;
functions and DOM nodes say what they are; and an object that stringifies to
`{}` reports its constructor rather than an empty shape.

---

### B8.13 Insertion was not moving nodes, which is what a keyed diff is made of

preactjs.com rendered 178 lines without script and 65 with it, with no errors
and nothing on the unsupported list: its shell and its sidebar, and nothing
where the article should be. Four things had to be ruled out before the cause
showed itself: the content JSON arrived (35 KB, 200), `DOMParser` parsed all
31 KB of it correctly (557 elements, 108 body children), the page settled rather
than being cut off, and the walk a markup renderer performs over a parsed tree
worked exactly as it should.

The bug was one line below all of that. **Inserting a node that already had a
parent lost it:**

```
built                    ABC   (3 children)
insertBefore(C, A)       AB    (2)   <- C gone
insertBefore(A, B)       B     (1)   <- A gone
```

The DOM defines insertion as removing the node from its old parent first. This
engine skipped that, and the tree underneath drops a node inserted while still
parented, so every *move* was a deletion. That is the operation a keyed diff is
built out of: preact reorders by re-inserting nodes it already holds, and each
reorder threw one away until the article was gone.

Detaching first fixes it, and preactjs.com now reads **178 lines with script,
matching its prerendered reading exactly**.

Two things worth keeping from how it was found. The failure was invisible to
every instrument in this project (no error, no unnamed API, no anonymous
console line) because nothing was *wrong* from the page's point of view; it
asked for a move and got a deletion. And the fixture harness had been running
every page's scripts twice, since `PageFactory::from_html` already runs them:
harmless for a script that assigns, wrong for one that appends. Both were found
by writing a test that appends.

---

### B8.14 Shadow DOM, flattened, and where the interrupt actually is

**Shadow DOM is built**, after two sites asked for `Element.shadowRoot` once the
performance work let them run far enough to want it. That is the rule this file
keeps: nothing is built until a page asks, and lit.dev and material-web asked.

This engine has one tree and blitz has no notion of a shadow one, so a shadow
root is a **view of the host element** and everything a component renders into
it lands in the host. The trade is stated rather than discovered:

* **Kept**: the content renders and is therefore readable, `host` and `mode`
  answer, `nodeType` is 11, a closed root is not handed out, and light children
  are projected into a `<slot>` if the component declares one, otherwise held
  aside, because a browser stops rendering them and showing a component's input
  beside its output would be worse than showing neither.
* **Lost**: encapsulation. `document.querySelector` reaches inside a shadow root
  here and would not in a browser, and styles do not scope.

That is the same flattening a browser's own accessibility tree performs, and for
an engine whose product is a readable account of a page it is the right half to
keep.

**The interrupt exists, and not where it is needed.** §B8.11 recorded that Boa
exposes no way to stop a running evaluation. That was wrong:
`Script::evaluate_async_with_budget` is public, and the VM yields to the caller
every N instructions: a real interrupt, for classic scripts. `Module` has only
`evaluate()`, with no budgeted variant, and lit.dev is modules end to end. So
the mechanism is there, the upstream ask has a precise shape,
`Module::evaluate_async_with_budget`, and until it exists a module graph is
still one uninterruptible unit.

---

### B8.15 A review pass: what it found in its own work

Going back over what had been built, rather than forward.

**Our own accessors were paying the reporting trap twice.** A getter invoked
with the proxy as `this` pays another trap for every `this._id` it reads, so
each accessor cost two. Passing the raw target as the receiver:

```
nodeType     2.15 -> 0.85 µs      tagName      1.80 -> 0.95 µs
parentNode   2.75 -> 1.55 µs      children    10.45 -> 7.75 µs
```

What it narrows is stated where the code is: a getter *defined by the page* on
its own class now runs with the target as `this`, so an unknown property read
inside one is not reported. Methods are unaffected, and the reporting that has
found real bugs has always been about properties a page reads *off* a node.

Two smaller ones on the same path: a node's kind is fixed when it is created and
was being asked of the tree on every `nodeType` read, and the document node's id
is constant and was being re-derived on every step of every upward walk.

**The ask list was being buried by generated keys.** jQuery and Sizzle stamp
elements with names like `jQuery360062973586668224961` and
`sizzle1786301869537` and read them before writing them; one corpus page
produced **5265 such "gaps"** and put them at the top of the list. No web
platform property carries a six-digit run, because it would have to be typed by
a person, so those are filtered, alongside the `_` and `$` prefixes already
filtered for the same reason.

**Where the application corpus stands after all of it:** 20/20 load, 17 usable
outlines, 2 render materially more with script, **0 render less**, 0 anonymous
errors, and **1 site** that cannot be read with script at all: lit.dev, whose
module graph is the one uninterruptible unit left (§B8.14).

---

### B8.16 The "cosmetic" duplication was text nodes being immutable

preactjs.com rendered its version as `v11.0.0-beta.111.0.0-beta.1`. It looked
cosmetic and was filed that way. It was not.

Reproduced with real preact against the page's actual markup: a single text
node `v1.0.0` hydrated against a vnode with two text children, which is what a
prerendered page gives a component that renders `v{version}`:

```
before   kids=1  text="v1.0.0"
after    kids=2  datas=["v1.0.0", "1.0.0"]      <- ours
after    kids=2  datas=["v", "1.0.0"]           <- a browser
```

Preact assigns `dom.data = 'v'` to the node it is reusing. **That write did
nothing**, because writing to a text node took the path meant for elements:
clear the children, which a text node has none of, and append a new text child, which
is meaningless. Blitz has `set_node_text` for exactly this and it was never
called.

So text nodes were immutable, and that is the single most common mutation any
reactive UI performs: every framework updates text by assigning `.data` or
`.nodeValue` to a node it already holds. The duplication was one visible symptom
of a general failure to apply text updates at all.

preactjs.com now reads **178 lines with script, matching its prerendered
reading**, and shows `v11.0.0-beta.2`, the version it *fetched*, where before it
showed the stale prerendered `beta.1` twice. The update applies now.

Worth noting how it was found: not by reading the DOM code, but by reproducing
the page's exact shape against the real library and comparing what each engine
ends up with. The bug was three layers below where it showed.

---

### B8.17 Measured against Chromium

`corpus/compare.py`, on this machine, both engines asked to do the same job:
fetch a page, run its script, produce a readable serialisation. Peak resident
memory is sampled across the **whole process tree**, because Chromium is
multi-process and measuring only the process we launched would flatter this
engine by several hundred megabytes for nothing.

```
page                    h5i                 chromium
documentation page       59 MiB   0.6s       513 MiB   0.8s
reference page           76 MiB   1.2s       563 MiB   0.4s
wiki article             73 MiB   0.5s       585 MiB   0.6s
news front page          56 MiB   0.9s       537 MiB   0.7s
single-page app          77 MiB   0.4s       541 MiB   0.4s
framework docs site      77 MiB   1.3s       580 MiB   1.0s

median peak RSS          76 MiB              563 MiB      7.4x less
median wall               0.9s                 0.7s       ~30% slower
install size           34 MiB               302 MiB      8.9x smaller
processes per page          1                    7
```

**What these numbers are, and are not.**

They are honest about the trade: this engine holds a page in about a seventh of
the memory, in one process rather than seven, from a binary a ninth the size,
and it is *slower*, because Chromium has a JIT and this has an interpreter.
Anyone quoting the memory figure without the speed one is quoting half a
measurement.

They are also not a claim of equivalence, and the corpus in §B8.6 is the reason:
of twenty applications, this engine reads seventeen usefully and **one not at
all**. Chromium reads all twenty. The right sentence is "a seventh of the memory
for the pages it can read", and the second half of that is doing real work.

The comparison deliberately records what each run actually *read*, so a run that
produced nothing cannot appear as a fast, small success. The counts are not
comparable to each other. Ours is a summarised outline capped at 300 lines,
Chromium's is a raw DOM dump, and they are there to prove each engine did the
work, not to be divided by one another.

Worth stating for anyone reaching for these in a comparison: this is one page
per process, which is how an agent reads. A long-lived Chromium amortises its
browser and GPU processes across many tabs and would look better per page.

---

### B8.18 Two more corpora, and the crash they found

Two writing systems' worth of blind spot, and a shape of page neither corpus
contained.

**International**: fourteen pages in CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Thai,
Devanagari, Greek, Cyrillic and Vietnamese. Text shaping, bidi and CJK line
breaking all run through parley, and every page measured until now was Latin: in
an engine whose entire product is extracted text, none of it had ever been
exercised. **14/14 load, 14 usable outlines, zero errors, zero anonymous
errors**, and the extracted text is correct, checked character by character
rather than by line count, because a corpus that counts lines would happily
report three hundred lines of mojibake.

**Structures**: big tables, forms, search results, plain RFCs, and markup old
enough to predate the conventions the rest of the web settled on. This one paid
immediately.

**The GNU bash manual crashed the engine.** One megabyte of single-page HTML,
and blitz panics with `attempt to subtract with overflow` in layout
construction. A panic is the one outcome an agent cannot act on: not a thin
page, not an error it can read, but a dead process and no answer at all.

Layout now runs behind a guard. The panic is caught, the document is read in
whatever state layout reached, and the snapshot says so: the page returns **500
lines and a note** where it used to return a stack trace and an exit code. The
first failure is kept rather than the last, because a later pass that happens to
survive does not undo the fact that the tree was laid out incompletely.

`AssertUnwindSafe` is the honest part of that: the document is behind a
`RefCell` a panic may leave mid-update, and reading a possibly-incomplete tree is
exactly the risk being taken in exchange for not having a dead process.

Also found and not yet built: `document.write` (caniuse), `CSSStyleSheet`,
`document.respec` (W3C specs). And pypi's search page is a JavaScript-detection
interstitial the challenge matcher does not recognise, which is a gap in the
matcher rather than in the engine.

---

### B8.19 Two of the three were worth building; one was not an API

`document.write`, `CSSStyleSheet` and `document.respec` came out of the
structures corpus. Checking each before building it turned out to matter.

**`document.respec` is not a web API.** The W3C pages call
`document.respec.ready.then(...)`: it is ReSpec's own global, a page expando in
the same class as Solid's `_$DX_DELEGATE`, and implementing it would have been
implementing someone's variable name. It stays reported, and the ask list
carrying it is the cost of a filter that cannot know every library's field.

**`document.write` is emulated where it can be and refused where it cannot.** A
browser inserts at the parser's position; this engine parses the whole document
before running anything, so that position does not exist, but `currentScript`
does, and inserting after it is the same place for the one deliberate use:
caniuse.com writes `<style>.static-only{display:none}</style>` from an inline
script. Called with no script running, a browser would implicitly `open()` and
**wipe the page**; that is refused by name instead, because the call would have
been harmless during parsing and the difference is this engine's script timing
rather than the page's intent.

**`CSSStyleSheet` is backed by a real `<style>` element**, so an adopted sheet's
rules reach Stylo rather than being remembered and ignored. `cssRules` is
deliberately left undefined: this engine does not model rules individually, and
answering an empty list for a sheet that plainly has rules is the confident
wrong answer it keeps having to refuse.

**And a bigger thing fell out of testing them.** The written
`<style>display:none</style>` did not hide anything, because **the outline does
not filter hidden content at all**. `display: none`, `visibility: hidden` and
the `hidden` attribute all appear in the reading:

```
paragraph 'visible'
paragraph 'display none'          <- a user cannot see this
paragraph 'visibility hidden'     <- nor this
paragraph 'hidden attribute'      <- nor this
```

That is a fidelity problem and a safety one. This engine's product is a faithful
account of what a page shows, and text a user cannot see is the classic vehicle
for instructions aimed at whatever is reading, and the fence in §B1 exists for
exactly that threat and this walks around it. It is the next thing to fix, and
it deserves care rather than a quick filter: content revealed later by script,
and the difference between `display: none` and off-screen accessibility text,
both decide whether a filter helps or quietly deletes the page.

---

### B8.20 Driving a page, and the sentence that contradicted itself

**Every corpus until now loaded a page and read it. None clicked anything.** An
agent's loop is read, act, read the difference, so two thirds of what this
engine is for went unmeasured, while the session verbs, the semantic delta and
the action-to-request correlation were all built and tested only in isolation.

`tests/corpus.rs` now drives as well as reads. Four fixtures, each asserting on
what the *delta* reports rather than on the page, because a change nobody can
see is the same as no change:

* typing into a field and submitting adds an item, and the delta names the new
  item without reporting the rest of the page as replaced;
* clicking a filter that rewrites a list reports the items that went and **not**
  the footer that did not;
* clicking something inert reports *no change*, which is a result an agent needs
  rather than the page handed back to be re-read;
* a router click moves the view and the address together, while the document's
  own URL stays put: the router moved, not the fetch.

They pass, which is worth stating plainly: the interaction path works, and it
had never been measured end to end.

**And `<noscript>` was in the outline.** A browser shows that content only when
script is off; this engine showed it always. So a page whose script ran
perfectly still handed an agent the sentence *"JavaScript is disabled in your
browser"*, not a cosmetic slip but a direct contradiction of the reading it
appeared in. crates.io's **entire outline was that sentence**.

crates.io now reports zero lines and a note saying so, which is the honest
answer: its SvelteKit app really does render nothing here. Why it does remains
undiagnosed: the entry shape reproduces perfectly in isolation, dynamic
`import()`, `currentScript.parentElement` and all 75 subresources check out
individually, and it is better recorded as unexplained than as fixed.

pypi's search page joins the challenge matcher, which also normalises
typographic apostrophes: pypi writes "couldn't" with U+2019, and a matcher that
only knew `'` would have missed it while looking like it had checked.

---

### B8.21 Hidden content is no longer read, and Chromium settled the argument

The outline carried `display: none` content, the `hidden` attribute, and
`visibility: hidden`. Two problems, and the second is the serious one: the
outline claims to be an account of what a page *shows*, and invisible text is the
classic vehicle for instructions aimed at whatever is reading it, the threat the
untrusted-content fence exists for, walked around by text a human never meets.

`display: none` and `hidden` are filtered now, asked of the style engine rather
than re-derived: a node with no primary styles is not rendered, and a node with
styles can still resolve to `display: none`, which is the common case because it
is what a stylesheet says. The first attempt checked only the former and filtered
the attribute while missing every CSS rule; the difference between the two took
a probe to find.

**`visibility: hidden` is deliberately kept.** That content occupies its space,
is routinely toggled by script, and is a shape off-screen accessibility text
sometimes takes; filtering it would risk deleting page content to fix a smaller
problem.

**The measurement then produced an alarming number, and it was right.** The Rust
book fell from 171 lines to **6**. That is the failure mode this change was
warned against, silently deleting a page, so it was checked against Chromium
rather than reasoned about: Chromium's DOM for the same page carries
`<html class="js light">` and **no `sidebar-visible` class**, so mdBook's sidebar
is not shown there either.

The six lines are the chapter: its heading, its opening paragraph, its list. The
165 that went were navigation **no reader ever sees**, and this engine had been
handing them to agents as page content. A number that looks like a regression is
worth checking against a browser before it is treated as one, and worth checking
before it is treated as a success, which is the same discipline pointing the
other way.

---

## B10. What is next, 2026-08-09

> **Superseded in part by §B11.** This section is the queue as it stood before
> Kitesurf was re-read against a built engine; §B11.5 is the current one. Kept
> because items 1 and 2 record how they were closed, and because item 4 is a
> useful example of the rule working: Shadow DOM was listed here as "if and when
> a page asks", a page asked, and §B8.14 built it.

Tiers 0 through 4 of the plan this section replaces are done. What the work
itself surfaced, in the order the evidence supports:

1. ~~The fourteen module failures~~: **four left** (§B8.10), each with a stack
   trace. Two are the Boa parser bug of §B8.11 and are upstream's to fix.
2. ~~Boa 0.21~~: **done**, pinned by revision on the dependency itself rather
   than through `[patch.crates-io]`: `=1.0.0-dev` *looked* like a pin and pinned
   nothing, since upstream's `main` carries that version string while changing
   daily. The commit hash now sits in the manifest of the crate that depends on
   it, where a reader looks for it, and nothing else in the workspace depends on
   boa so the patch indirection bought nothing (§B8.10).
   The pin should move to a release when boa cuts one, and the `[patch]` block
   deleted then. That is no longer a thing to remember:
   `scripts/check_boa_release.sh` asks crates.io on every CI run whether a
   published boa's icu requirements have stopped clashing with blitz's parley,
   and fails the build the day one has. It reads parley's requirement from the
   lockfile rather than assuming it, so it stays true when blitz moves, and it
   has a floor at 0.21, the first version with source positions, because
   older releases predate the icu dependency and so "do not clash" while being
   unusable. The first draft recommended 0.17 for exactly that reason.
3. **Two sites that now time out**, lit.dev and material-web, because they get
   further than they used to. Either the engine gets faster or the corpus learns
   to report a partial render as a result rather than a failure.
3. **The realm costs ~20ms to start** and is rebuilt per page. A resident
   session that reuses one realm across navigations would remove it from every
   step after the first. Measured, not guessed; see §B8.9.
4. **Shadow DOM**, if and when a page in §B8 asks. Two design-system sites in the
   application corpus use it and neither asked, because their docs pages are
   server-rendered. Adding it now would be building for a page we have not met.
5. **A corpus that needs a login.** Everything measured so far is public, so
   LOGIN mode and the cookie jar are tested but not *exercised* against a real
   session-gated application. That is the next honest extension of §B8, and the
   one most likely to find something surprising.

The rule that produced everything above stays: **nothing is built until a page
asks for it, and an instrument that cannot name what is missing is fixed before
anything it failed to name.**

---

## B11. Kitesurf, re-read against a built engine, 2026-08-09

§7.1 surveyed Kitesurf on 2026-08-07 and drew the routing rule from
it: two engines, by origin, one policy. That section remains the authority on
*position*. This one is narrower and later. The engine now exists, so the
question is no longer "what does this mean for scope" but **"what does the
comparison change about the order of work"**, which is what this file is for.

### B11.1 The stack is less shared than it looks

Read casually, Kitesurf is this engine with a Cloudflare account attached: Blitz
for HTML and layout, Stylo for CSS, Parley for text shaping, Rust throughout.
The JS is the exception and it is the important one. **Page script runs on V8**,
because a Worker already is V8; Boa appears only for `eval`, as a stand-in until
Workers exposes dynamic evaluation natively. §B7.1 recorded this and
it stands.

Three things follow, and the first two are corrections to a comparison that is
tempting to make and wrong:

* **The wall-time figures are not comparable.** Kitesurf reports 1.7-1.8x slower
  than Chromium; §B8.17 measured this engine at roughly 1.3x. That is not a win.
  Theirs includes an isolate boundary and a WASM-compiled DOM; ours includes an
  interpreter where theirs has a JIT. Different corpora, different hardware,
  different bottlenecks. Neither number bounds the other and neither should be
  quoted against the other.
* **Boa still carries no precedent.** The hope that Kitesurf's success validated
  Boa for real web applications does not survive reading what Kitesurf runs
  script on. It does not use Boa for that. This engine is the precedent, which
  means §B8's corpus is not a nice-to-have measurement, it is the only evidence
  that exists. The swap trigger at §B7.1 is unchanged.
* **Memory is the comparison that survives.** Kitesurf reports 4.7-7.0x less
  than Chromium; §B8.17 measured 7.4x. Those are close, measured the same way,
  and both are large. This is the number to state.

### B11.2 What the comparison does not change

Three of Kitesurf's stated gaps are already answered here and should not be
re-opened as work:

* **Video and WebGL.** Not in scope for the light engine, and not a gap, because
  a coding agent testing a video player is testing its own application, which is
  loopback, which routes to Chromium. Kitesurf must name these because it has no
  Chromium half. We do (§B7.1).
* **Persistent authenticated sessions.** Kitesurf cannot have them; this is the
  one place where "there is a human at this machine" is a capability and not a
  limitation. `session login` hands the page to the person at the viewer and
  takes it back (§B5.4, §B8.20). Answered, though see 11.6.
* **Speed.** Never the claim, for the reason at the top of this file: shipping
  less browser beats any benchmark table, so a benchmark table is not a moat.

### B11.3 What it does change: two gaps, and one advantage never stated

**Gap 1: CDP.** The ecosystem converged on the Chrome DevTools Protocol, and
Kitesurf speaks it, which means everything already written against Playwright,
Puppeteer and `chrome-remote-interface` works there and not here. This engine
has a bespoke JSON control channel that nothing else targets. The session state
that CDP would need already exists behind `serve`; what is missing is the wire
format and an honest account of the subset.

**Gap 2: conformance.** Kitesurf can say 215,000+ Web Platform Tests. This
engine can say seventy pages across four corpora. The corpora have been worth
every hour spent on them and they found things WPT never would, because they are
real pages. But they cannot answer "what fraction of the platform is
implemented", and that is the question every capability decision below depends
on. **This is an instrument gap before it is a capability gap**, which by this
file's own rule puts it ahead of the capabilities it would measure.

**The advantage: reach.** A cloud browser cannot open `localhost:3000`, a
staging host, an internal admin panel, or anything behind a VPN. For a *coding*
agent that is not an edge case, it is a large share of everything it needs to
look at. This has never been written down as a property of the design, and it is
a stronger and more concrete statement than "local-first" or "private": it is
not that we decline to send the page elsewhere, it is that for these pages there
is nowhere to send it from. It belongs beside receipts in how this engine is
described.

### B11.4 MCP: decided against, 2026-08-09

Kitesurf ships an MCP server and this engine will not, because the two are
answering different questions. MCP exists to give an agent a tool surface across
a process boundary it cannot cross. **Here there is no such boundary**: the
agent runs on this machine, in the same box as the engine, and
`h5i-browser-light session snapshot` is already a tool it can call. A protocol
server would wrap the CLI in a socket so that the thing on the other end could
call the CLI.

The condition that would reopen this is specific: an agent that must drive this
engine **without being able to run a subprocess**. If one appears, MCP is the
right answer for it and this decision was still right until then.

Note that CDP (11.3) is not the same call and does not fall to the same
argument. MCP would re-expose verbs the CLI already exposes to a caller that can
already call them; CDP would let a large body of *existing* software drive this
engine, none of which is going to be rewritten against our CLI.

### B11.5 The queue

Ordered by what the evidence supports, not by size.

**First, because it is the least-verified thing we claim.**

1. **A corpus that needs a login.** Unchanged from §B10.5 and now more urgent, not
   less: 11.2 names authenticated sessions as an answered gap, and it is answered
   by a mechanism that has never been exercised against a real session-gated
   application. The strongest claim in this file rests on the least-tested code
   in it.

**Second, because everything after it is better informed.**

2. **Run the Web Platform Tests.** Start where the corpus already lives:
   `dom/`, `html/dom/`, `css/cssom/`. Needs a `testharness.js` driver, a
   committed baseline, and a CI gate on regression rather than on an absolute
   number.
3. **Publish the number, whatever it is.** A measured forty thousand is worth
   more than an unmeasured claim, and an engine that names what it cannot do
   (§B8.3) does not get to make an exception for its own conformance.

**Third, the interoperability work, sized once 2 has told us what we can claim.**

4. **A CDP subset over WebSocket.** The useful floor: `Target` attach/create,
   `Page.navigate|captureScreenshot|loadEventFired`,
   `Runtime.evaluate|callFunctionOn|consoleAPICalled`,
   `DOM.getDocument|querySelector|getBoxModel`,
   `Input.dispatchMouseEvent|dispatchKeyEvent`, `Network` request/response
   events plus cookie get and set, `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`.
5. **The unimplemented half of CDP must be loud.** A partial protocol that
   answers to the name of the whole one is the `missingApi` lie at protocol
   scale (§B8.4): Playwright will call methods we do not have, and a silent or
   plausible answer there is worse than an error, for exactly the reason a
   plausible wrong answer is worse than no answer anywhere else in this engine.
   An unimplemented method returns a named error and the conformance list is
   published.
6. **REST quick actions**: screenshot, extract, PDF. Nearly free once 4 exists.

**Fourth, the gaps the corpus itself found.** These are §B8's list and are ordered
by how many pages asked.

7. Boa `Module::evaluate_async_with_budget` (lit.dev evaluates unbounded, §B8.14),
   the Boa `let`/`const` parser bug (§B8.11), the blitz layout panic (§B8.18). All
   three are upstream's and all three are filed.
8. **Canvas 2D**, the largest single missing API by corpus demand.
9. **WebSocket and EventSource.** A live application shows nothing without them.
10. **IndexedDB**, in memory only, consistent with §B6's storage line.
11. **`getComputedStyle` answers almost nothing** (`color` came back empty). It
    is implemented far enough to look implemented, which §B8.3 established is the
    worst state for anything in this engine to be in.
12. **crates.io renders nothing** and the cause is still unknown. SvelteKit-
    shaped; the entry path was verified working in isolation, so the failure is
    somewhere the isolation removed.

**Fifth, performance, none of which is urgent.**

13. **Reuse the realm across navigations.** ~20ms per page, rebuilt every time,
    measured in §B8.9.
14. **Cache the prelude's bytecode.** Three thousand lines of JavaScript parsed
    per realm.
15. There is no JIT and there will not be one. The cost is stated in 11.1 and
    the answer to it is 11.3's reach and §B8.17's memory, not a faster
    interpreter.

**Sixth, the moat, which is mostly already built and under-described.**

16. **Receipts as a checkable artifact.** The one thing Kitesurf's announcement
    does not address at all. Today the guarantee is "no receipt, no request" and
    it is true; what it is not is *verifiable by someone who does not trust the
    binary that wrote it*.
17. **Measure and state the delta snapshot** (§B8.20). No comparable engine
    appears to have one, and re-reading three hundred lines after every click is
    the shape everyone else's agent loop is stuck in.

### B11.6 Two conflicts to settle deliberately

Both are cases where §B6's "never" list collides with something 11.5 wants. Each
should be decided in writing rather than discovered in a corpus run.

**Login flows use iframes and popups; §B6 refuses both.** The strongest claim in
11.2 is persistent authenticated sessions, and real-world OAuth is an iframe or
a popup almost every time. §B5.4's human handoff sidesteps part of this, because
a person at the viewer can complete a flow the engine could not drive, but it
does not help when the flow needs a second browsing context to *exist* at all.
Either §B6 gains a narrow, argued exception for authentication boundaries, or the
login claim is honestly scoped down to form posts. It cannot stay as it is: item
11.5.1 will decide this whether or not it is decided first, and it is better
written down in advance.

**PDF.** §B6 refuses "printing", by which it meant the print UI, and item 11.5.6
wants `printToPDF`. These are not the same feature: one is chrome around a page,
the other is a serialisation of it, and an agent asked to keep a record of what
it read wants the second. Recommended as an exception, on the grounds that the
raster path (`blitz-paint`, vello_cpu) already produces everything it needs.

## B12. Running WPT, 2026-08-09 to 08-10

§B11.5.2 argued that seventy corpus pages cannot answer "what fraction of the
platform is implemented", and put conformance ahead of the capabilities it
would measure. This is that work. The rule it operates under is §B8's: **an
instrument that cannot name what is missing is fixed before anything it failed
to name**, and the instrument needed fixing three times before its numbers were
worth quoting.

### B12.1 The instrument

`wpt/serve.py` serves a WPT checkout and substitutes one file.
`resources/testharnessreport.js` is shipped by WPT as an empty seam for a vendor
to fill, so ours fills it and the results come back through the console, which
`open --json` already reports. **Nothing was added to the engine to make it
measurable.** An instrument that requires the subject to grow a port for it is
measuring something other than the subject.

`wpt/run.py` keeps six outcomes apart and lets only three contribute subtests:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `ok` / `harness_error` / `harness_timeout` | the harness reported. Real data. |
| `no_report` | the engine exited cleanly and the harness never reported. **Unmeasured, not zero.** |
| `engine_timeout` / `engine_crash` | unmeasured. |

`no_report` is the bucket worth chasing: it is where one engine gap stops a file
before it can say what it failed, so emptying it moves the score in steps rather
than in ones. Every fix in 12.2 came out of it.

`wpt/sweep.sh` runs one directory at a time and `wpt/merge.py` totals them.
Chunked for a reason learned the hard way: a single process holding two hours of
results loses all of them when something kills it, and something did. Each test
process also runs under an address-space cap, because several WPT files allocate
until something gives and without a cap the kernel picks the victim, which on
this 8 GiB box was the whole session rather than the test.

### B12.2 Twenty files, four bugs, and a suite that scored zero

The first twenty files scored **0**. Not because the engine was that far off:
one missing binding stopped testharness.js before its first assertion.

* **`self` was undefined.** testharness walks `w != w.parent` from `self` before
  it can run anything. Added with `parent`, `top`, `frames`, `length`,
  `frameElement` and `opener`, not stubs, because §B6 refuses iframes and
  popups, so this document is always a top-level context and every value is what
  a real browser reports for one.
* **The load lifecycle was never fired.** No `DOMContentLoaded`, no `load`, and
  `document.readyState` was the constant `"complete"`. That constant is exactly
  why four corpora never caught it: it makes the *common* idiom work (read
  `readyState === "loading"`, otherwise initialise now), so every page took the
  immediate branch and nothing looked wrong. The other branch never arrived.
  testharness gates every result it will ever report on one `load` listener with
  no readyState fallback, so it scored nothing while looking merely slow.
* **`insertBefore` with an unparented reference node killed the process**, which
  WPT does on purpose. A panic is not a DOM error: it takes the page, the
  snapshot and the receipts with it.
* **`insertAdjacentText` was missing**, which blocked eight files at once
  because testharness renders its own results table with it.

Twenty files went 0 → 199. The fifth fix is the one that found the fourth:
**timer errors now carry a stack**. They said only "timer threw" and withheld
the one thing a caller needs. That has since been applied to all eight callbacks
that swallow an error: a listener, a timer, an observer are each detached from
whatever scheduled them, so the message is all the reader gets.

### B12.3 What the instrument was getting wrong about itself

Two corrections, both of which made the engine look worse than it is:

**276 of 1,503 files never load testharness.js.** Reftests compare renderings
and crashtests only have to not crash; neither can report a result no matter how
well the engine runs it. They were sitting in the unmeasured bucket looking like
engine failures. Counted and named separately, unmeasured fell from 643 to 367
without a single test changing behaviour.

**A large share of WPT is not on disk.** `x.any.js` becomes `x.any.html`,
`x.any.worker.html` and more at serve time, and a static server cannot produce
them. 3,833 such endpoints are skipped and the count is printed, so the
denominator is never mistaken for "all of WPT".

### B12.4 The baseline, and what it asked for

First full on-disk sweep: **33,754 subtests passing of 212,028 scored**, 25,393
files, of which 16,857 reported and 8,536 did not. 36,450 further files were
skipped as unscoreable and 3,833 as generated. §B12.8 records where that number
went and, more usefully, how much of the gap was measurement rather than engine.

The most valuable output is not the score, it is the demand list: every API the
tests asked for and this engine does not have, counted. The top of it:

```
3944  Element.hasChildNodes        1197  getComputedStyle(margin-left)
2208  Element.sheet                1012  getComputedStyle(scale)
1571  document.styleSheets          972  Element.offsetTop
1501  Element.getContext            926  getComputedStyle(z-index)
1468  Element.setHTMLUnsafe         863  navigator.serviceWorker
```

`hasChildNodes` is one line and was asked for 3,944 times, more than twice
anything else. Nothing in four hand-picked corpora used it and everything in the
DOM test suite does. That is the case for a conformance suite in one sentence.

### B12.5 What was built, and what was deliberately not

**Typed reflection.** `dir` is an enumerated attribute whose IDL getter answers
"" for anything that is not one of its keywords, so `setAttribute("dir", "5%")`
reads back as "" in a browser and read back as "5%" here. WPT sets every
reflected attribute to sixty-odd hostile values and checks exactly that, which
is how an engine scores zero on an attribute it believed it had. There is now
one `reflect()` with a type per shape (string, nullable, bool, long, ulong,
enumerated, url), and `long` implements the spec's rules for parsing integers,
which are not `Number()`.

**Per-tag interfaces.** Sixty tags now carry their own class and the spec's
reflection table, because `colSpan` belongs to `<td>` and hanging it on every
element makes `"colSpan" in div` true, the same lie the removed `missingApi`
stubs told.

**Every computed longhand.** The note in `computed_style` claimed Stylo had no
generic accessor to bind against, so six properties were hand-listed and
everything else answered "". That was a wrong belief about the dependency, not a
considered scope: `computed_value_to_string` does exactly this. `color` came
back empty (§B11.5.11) and now returns `rgb(0, 0, 0)`.

**Not chased at the time: the legacy CJK encoding tests.** ~~They need legacy
encoder tables in the URL serialiser, wptserve variants, and `<iframe>`, which §B6
refuses outright: the clearest opportunity this suite offers to move a number
without improving the engine for anyone.~~

**That paragraph was wrong on all three counts, and §B12.10 is the correction.**
The struck text is kept because the shape of the error is worth more than the
conclusion was:

* **~17,000 was the wrong size.** Measured before the generated endpoints and
  before the timeout fix; the block is **220,367** unpassed subtests, the
  largest in WPT by a factor of two.
* **`<iframe>` is not required.** The `iframe { display:none }` in those files is
  dead boilerplate from a shared template. 162,892 of the subtests are `-href-`
  tests: build an `<a href>` in a euc-jp document and read `.href` back. No
  iframe, no form, no `.py` handler.
* **It is a real feature, not a scoring artefact.** This engine ignores
  `<meta charset>` outright: `document.characterSet` is `undefined`, and a
  euc-jp page's URLs are percent-encoded as UTF-8. An agent reading a legacy
  Japanese page gets the wrong answer today. "Without improving the engine for
  anyone" was simply false.

The error was reading a *sample* failure message and generalising from the file
name around it, rather than asking what the assertion needed. Three sentences of
confident scope-cutting, none of them checked.

### B12.6 Reading the number honestly

Three things move this score and only one of them is engineering:

1. **Implementing more.** On a fixed nine-directory sample, 5,345 → 6,876.
   html/dom alone, 3,223 → 6,035 across the two reflection commits.
2. **Measuring more.** Going from nine directories to all 223 took the total to
   33,754 without a line of engine code. This is legitimate, since Kitesurf's 215,000
   is across all of WPT too, but it is not improvement, and a report that
   blurred the two would be worth nothing.
3. **Counting more honestly**, which moves it *down* as often as up.

So the targets are worth restating in those terms, and the restatement below is
the *original* one, kept because it was wrong in an instructive way:

> **10,000 is passed**, and mostly by (2). **50,000** is reachable by (1), the
> demand list is mechanical work, and 8,536 files still report nothing at all.
> **100,000** is not reachable on this path. It needs the generated endpoints,
> which means serving what wptserve serves, and whole subsystems this engine
> does not have and mostly should not: canvas, service workers, XSLT.

All three targets were passed, and the last one was passed without any of the
subsystems that paragraph said it required. §B12.8 is why.

### B12.7 What is next

1. **Empty the `no_report` bucket.** 8,536 files report nothing; the causes are
   already grouped by the runner and the top few will cover most of them.
2. **CSSOM**: `Element.sheet`, `document.styleSheets`. 3,779 asks between them.
3. **The remaining computed values**: shorthands, custom properties, and the
   layout-dependent resolutions Stylo alone cannot know.
4. **A CI gate on regression**, not on an absolute number: the baseline is
   committed, and a change that drops it should have to say why.

### B12.8 Where the number actually was, 2026-08-10

> Superseded by §B13.2: the total is now 333,690. This section stays as written
> because what it says about *why* the number moved is unchanged, and because
> §B13.3 is the same lesson arriving a second time: a large number that comes
> from one place has to say so.

**117,331 subtests passing of 585,474 scored**, 26,052 files, 25,252 of which
report. That is up from 33,754, and it is worth being exact about how much of
that is the engine getting better and how much is this file learning to read.

Three changes account for most of it, and only one is an engine change.

**The engine was being killed while testharness drew a table.**
`html/dom/reflection-tabular.html` took 40.6 seconds and scored **zero**, because
the harness's process timeout fired first. Those forty seconds were not tests:
testharness renders one DOM row per subtest into `#log` when it finishes, and
that file has forty thousand of them. The tests themselves are about half a
second of DOM work.

`setup({ output: false })`, a documented harness setting and what the official
WPT runner uses, turns the rendering off. Results already came back through the
completion callback, so the table was pure overhead.

    reflection-tabular   40.6s → 1.98s
    html/dom, whole dir  minutes → 26s
    html/dom passing     6,234 → 43,429

The timeout had been raised to 120 seconds an hour earlier, on the reading that
this engine needed more wall clock than a JIT to run the same test. That reading
was true and irrelevant: a generous timeout was paying a harness cost rather than
removing it. **The first measurement said "this engine is too slow for these
tests"; the second said "these tests spend their time drawing a table nobody
reads".** Only one of those is about the engine, and tens of thousands of
subtests were written off on the strength of the wrong one.

**A computed style did not declare its properties.** `"color" in
getComputedStyle(el)` was false for every property: the object is a proxy with
only a `get` trap, and `in` asks `has`. WPT's `test_computed_value` asserts
exactly that on its first line and is *the* helper for CSS parsing tests, so
thousands of subtests failed before comparing a value. css-color went 1,213 →
4,509 without one line of colour code changing: Stylo already supported
`color-mix()`, `oklch()`, relative colours and `color()`, and this engine was
already serialising them correctly. The tests could not get far enough to look.

**Style was never recomputed on demand** (§B12.5's list), which is what the
CSSOM tests needed and what any page that builds its DOM in script needs.

The pattern across all three, and across §B8's history: **a large failure cluster
usually has one cheap structural cause, not N expensive ones.** Three for three
here. An hour of reading actual failure messages has repeatedly been worth more
than a week of implementing what the failure count seemed to ask for.

#### What this does and does not claim

It does not claim the engine is fast. A 40-second file becoming a 2-second file
is the harness no longer being measured; the engine is still an interpreter and
still around 1.3x Chromium's wall time on real pages (§B8.17). Conformance
measured with a fair harness and speed on real pages are separate claims and
should stay separate.

It does not claim parity with a browser. 453,864 subtests still fail, and the
largest blocks are named in §B12.5 and §B12.10: legacy document encodings (in
progress), the combinatorial half of `execCommand`, and the multi-origin
security suites that need wptserve's Python handlers.

It does claim that the number is honest. Nothing was counted that was not run,
`NOTRUN` and `TIMEOUT` are reported separately from `FAIL`, files that cannot be
scored are named rather than blamed on the engine, and every subtest counted here
was already passing before the harness stopped killing it.

### B12.9 The gate, and why it is not in CI

`wpt/gate.sh` runs five directories against a committed floor in
`wpt/baseline.json`. It is a **local** instrument, run before a change that
touches the engine's DOM or CSS surface, not a CI job, and the first attempt to
make it one is worth recording, because it failed for a reason that is not about
runtime.

A pass count is only a floor if the corpus is fixed. WPT is not: the CI runner
sparse-checked-out its own revision and scored `encoding` out of 142,445
subtests where this machine scored it out of 229,349. Both numbers were right
about different corpora. Comparing a count against a moving upstream measures
upstream, and would have failed builds that changed nothing.

Wall-clock made it worse rather than caused it: several of those directories
only score what they score because large files finish inside a timeout, so a
slower runner loses subtests without anything regressing.

So CI keeps the *behaviours* instead, hermetically. `src/script/tests.rs` has a
"what WPT found" block: the lifecycle firing, named globals, typed reflection,
per-tag properties, computed style declaring itself and recomputing on demand,
stylesheet rules that write back, `TextDecoder` validating its label, unhandled
rejections reported, and the two crashes a page could use to kill the engine.
Those are fixed things, they run in a second, and they fail only when the engine
changes.

The floor still exists for the case it was built for: this branch gave back
3,142 subtests in `html` to a settle-loop rewrite, and nothing caught it but a
manual diff. `wpt/gate.sh` is what to run before believing a refactor was free.

---

## B13. Legacy document encodings, and a number that needs a caveat

§B12.5 wrote the legacy CJK encoding tests off in three sentences. All three were
wrong, the correction is recorded in place there, and this section is what
happened when the work was actually done.

### B13.1 What was missing

This engine decoded every document as UTF-8. A page served as euc-jp came out as
replacement characters, `document.characterSet` did not exist, and a link's
query was percent-encoded from the wrong bytes. An agent reading a legacy
Japanese page got the wrong answer and was told nothing about it.

`src/encoding.rs` settles the two things a document's encoding decides.

**Which encoding.** BOM, then the transport's `Content-Type`, then the markup's
`<meta charset>` or `<meta http-equiv>`, then UTF-8. The prescan stops at 1024
bytes because the HTML standard's does, and that bound is load bearing rather
than an optimisation: a declaration further down cannot be honoured, because by
then a parser has committed. Agreeing with a browser about pages that declare
too late is the point.

**How a query is encoded.** The URL Standard encodes a query with the
*document's* encoding, and a code point that encoding cannot represent becomes
an HTML numeric character reference. `丂` in a euc-jp page is `%26%2319970%3B`,
where this engine answered `%E4%B8%82`, the right escape of the wrong bytes,
which is the shape of wrong answer that is hardest to notice.

That needed the per-character encoder rather than `encoding_rs::encode`. The
bulk call renders an unmappable code point as the literal `&#19970;`, and `&`,
`#` and `;` are not in the query percent-encode set, so they pass through and
the answer becomes `&%2319970;`. The URL Standard appends `%26%23`, the decimal
value and `%3B` (the reference *already* percent-encoded) precisely so a
generated reference cannot be mistaken for a real separator.

Also found on the way: local files were loaded with `read_to_string`, which
**refuses** a file that is not valid UTF-8, exactly the file this path most
needs to open.

### B13.2 The number, and why it is checked rather than quoted

**333,690 subtests passing of 584,707 scored**, from 117,331. 26,052 files run,
25,249 of which report.

That is a large enough jump in one commit to deserve disbelief, so it was
checked three ways before being written down.

* **Nothing is counted twice.** 25,247 distinct test files across the sweep,
  none run more than once. The largest single file reports 21,269 subtests under
  21,269 distinct names.
* **The answers are right.** The same page was run in Chromium 1140 and the
  output is byte-identical, including two cases where Python's own `euc_jp`
  codec *disagrees*: Python encodes U+4E02 into JIS X 0212, and WHATWG's euc-jp
  decodes that plane but never encodes to it. Matching the browser rather than
  the naive codec is not something reached by accident.
* **The engine is doing it, not the harness.** `document.characterSet` reports
  EUC-JP, the text decodes as itself, and an unmappable code point becomes a
  numeric reference, each asserted in `src/script/tests.rs`.

### B13.3 The caveat that has to travel with it

**70% of every passing subtest comes from twenty files.** The top eleven are all
`*-encode-href-*.html`: one behaviour (encode a character into a URL query)
repeated once per codepoint across the CJK range, for five encodings.

| framing | subtests |
| --- | --- |
| Headline total | 333,690 |
| **Excluding the encoding directory** | **107,904** |
| Excluding just the CJK block | 116,428 |
| From the top twenty files alone | 235,977 |

Files that pass *completely*: **1,882** of the 20,506 with any scored subtest.

So 333,690 is true and describes one feature with an enormous test count rather
than broad platform coverage. Both halves of that sentence have to be said
together, and §B12.6's rule applies unchanged: implementing more, measuring more
and counting more honestly are three different things, and only the first is
engineering.

**The Kitesurf comparison: withdrawn, 2026-08-19.** This section previously
worked an arithmetic argument to the conclusion that Kitesurf's stated
"215,000+ tests passing" could not include the CJK block, and therefore that a
like-for-like reading put this engine at about half their breadth. The argument
was wrong, and it is worth keeping the wreckage because the mistake is a tidy
example of the thing this file keeps warning about.

It ran: the CJK `encode-href` block is 217,263 subtests, which is larger than
Kitesurf's whole stated total, so they cannot be passing it. That inference
treats a block as **pass-all-or-none**. Nothing requires an engine to pass every
subtest in a directory, and partial coverage is the normal case for all of them,
including this one. An engine passing 150,000 of that block has a total entirely
consistent with 215,000 and a number that includes CJK encoding. The premise
does not support the conclusion, and the like-for-like table built on it does
not stand.

What actually follows is narrower and less satisfying: **the two numbers are not
comparable in either direction.** Two reasons, and either is sufficient. Their
harness is not this one, and this one cannot reach workers, `.py` handlers or
TLS, so it scores 584,707 subtests where a full wptserve run reaches roughly two
million: the denominators are different corpora. And the composition of their
number is not published, so subtracting our CJK block while leaving theirs in
place would be a comparison rigged in our own favour, which is the same error in
the other direction.

So there is no defensible comparison here, and this file should not have printed
one. **The claim that survives is entirely about this engine and needs no
competitor at all:** 333,690 is true, 65% of it is one block, and both halves
have to be said together.

The failure mode is §B12.8's, arriving in a new place. That entry recorded that
a large failure cluster usually has one cheap structural cause, and that an hour
of reading actual failure messages beats a week of implementing what a count
seemed to ask for. This is the same lesson pointed at a *comparison*: an
arithmetic argument that felt conclusive was doing the work that reading the
other engine's published methodology should have done. Comparative claims about
someone else's number need their methodology, not our calculator.

### B13.4 What this is worth, plainly

The engineering is worth having on its own: a legacy page now reads correctly,
which is a real capability an agent needs and did not have. The score is a
consequence, not the reason, and the twenty-file concentration is the reason to
say so out loud rather than let a headline imply 333,690 distinct capabilities.

---

## B14. Reviewing the engine against a real browser, 2026-08-10

The reviews in §B8 and §B11 read code and reasoned about specs. This one diffed
behaviour against Chromium 1140, and the difference in yield is the finding
worth keeping: **thirteen bugs in an afternoon, four of them in code whose
comments explicitly argued for the wrong answer.** Reasoning about what an
engine should do had been checking the reasoning, not the engine.

The method is a page of one-assertion-per-line probes, run in both engines and
compared. `wpt/` finds gaps against a specification; this finds disagreements
with the thing the user will actually compare against.

### B14.1 The encoding work, three days old and already wrong

* **Existing percent-escapes were destroyed.** The query was decoded after
  parsing and re-encoded, which cannot work: once `url::Url` has run, an
  author's `%41` and a `%E4%B8%82` the parser made from a raw `丂` are both just
  `%XX`. `?x=%41` became `?x=A`; `?100%25` became `?100%`, an escape the page
  wrote turned into an invalid one. Now encoded from the raw text before any
  parser touches it.
* **An undeclared legacy page was destroyed**: the worst of the three, because
  it is the document the module exists to rescue. Undeclared bytes fell back to
  UTF-8, so a windows-1252 page had every high byte replaced by U+FFFD:
  `café naïve` read as `caf<?> na<?>ve`. The fallback is now asymmetric on
  purpose, and the asymmetry is the point: windows-1252 read as UTF-8 loses the
  text outright, while UTF-8 read as windows-1252 is mojibake but lossless.
  Given a guess must be made, take the recoverable wrong answer.
* An empty query reported `"?"` where a browser reports `""`.

### B14.2 A code block is not one long line

Every `<pre>` arrived as a single run-on line, which for an engine that reads
documentation is a poor reading of the thing it reads most.

The fix is not to stop collapsing. `Snapshot::render`'s fence rests on **no
page-derived value spanning a line**, because a value that can start a line can
forge the closing marker. So a `<pre>` is split on its own breaks and each piece
becomes an outline line, collapsed individually with its own indent and `- `.
The invariant is untouched and the structure survives, verified by putting the
literal closing marker inside a `<pre>` and watching it come back as
`[fence marker removed]`.

### B14.3 Nine more, from sixty-four assertions

`{ once: true }` was read at registration and never consulted at dispatch, so
listeners fired every time, and the same handler registered twice made two
listeners where a browser makes one. An invalid selector answered `null` instead
of throwing, which is indistinguishable from "no such element", so a page with a
typo took its not-found branch and never learned why. `textContent = null` wrote
the four characters `null`. `tabIndex` answered -1 for links and buttons, telling
a page nothing was focusable. `isEqualNode`, `normalize` and `isSameNode` were
absent and `compareDocumentPosition` called connected nodes disconnected. Style
serialisation lost its trailing semicolon, and emptying a declaration removed
the attribute instead of leaving `""`.

63 of 64 cases now match Chromium exactly.

### B14.4 The one that is not a bug: `Intl`

`Intl` is undefined, so `toLocaleString()` answers `1234.5` where a browser
answers `1,234.5`, and `toLocaleDateString()` returns a full date string rather
than `12/31/1969`. A page that formats numbers or dates for display shows
different text to this engine than to a person.

Enabling boa's `intl_bundled` **does not build**: it wants `icu_provider 2.2`,
which conflicts with what parley already pins through blitz. That is the same
disjoint-ICU wall that dictated the boa revision pin in the first place (§B12.2),
arriving from the other side. It is recorded here rather than filed as a task,
because nothing in this repository can move it: it needs the two ICU lines
upstream to converge.

### B14.5 What this says about how to look

Three review passes on this engine have now found bugs at very different rates.
Reading code found some. Running a conformance suite found more, and found the
*instrument's* faults as a side effect. Diffing against a browser found the most
per hour, and, the part worth internalising, **it found bugs in code whose own
comments had reasoned carefully to the wrong conclusion.** A comment cannot
falsify itself. Another implementation can.

## B15. Two more reference engines, and the bug reading them found, 2026-08-19

§B11 read Kitesurf against a built engine and asked what the comparison changed
about the *order* of work. This section does the same for two engines that are
closer to us in purpose than Kitesurf is: **Lightpanda** (`~/Ref/browser`, Zig,
V8 plus html5ever, CDP and MCP) and **Obscura** (`~/Ref/obscura`, Rust, V8 via
deno_core, CDP and MCP, ~132k lines across nine crates). Both describe
themselves as headless browsers *for AI agents*. Neither has receipts, a policy
layer, or a box; both have an agent-driving surface several times the size of
ours.

The comparison is therefore lopsided in a useful way. It says almost nothing
about the engine and a great deal about **the verbs on top of it**, which is
where the honest reading is that we are behind.

### B15.1 What the reading found first: a ref resolves against a page the agent never saw

Before any of the design comparison, the read found a defect in our own control
channel, and it is the kind §B8.3 singles out as the worst state for anything
here to be in: a plausible wrong answer that looks like a right one.

`type`, `submit` and `click` each take a **fresh** snapshot at action time and
resolve the agent's `@ref` against that (`stream.rs:863`, `:885`, `:917`):

```rust
let snapshot = session.page.snapshot();
let Some(entry) = snapshot.resolve(reference) else { ... };
```

References are minted by walk order (`snapshot.rs:590`):

```rust
let id = format!("e{}", self.next_ref);
self.next_ref += 1;
```

So `e5` does not name an element. It names **the fifth actionable thing in this
walk**. The agent read snapshot *N* and is acting against snapshot *N+1*, taken
now. If anything moved in between — a settle that ran, a script mutation, an
element inserted earlier in document order — `e5` resolves to a *different
element*, `click` succeeds, and the reply says `{"ok": true, "ref": "e5"}`.
Nothing anywhere detects it.

There is no memory-safety problem: the node id is freshly minted, so the click
lands on a real node. That is precisely what makes it bad. The failure is
silent, it is indistinguishable from success, and the engine's whole claim is
that it does not hand an agent a plausible lie.

**The minimum fix** is a generation counter: stamp each snapshot, return it,
require it back on any verb taking a `@ref`, and refuse a mismatch by name
rather than acting on it. That converts a silent wrong action into a loud one
and is a small change.

**The right fix** is two handle types, which is §B15.4.

This is also a comment on method. §B14.5 ranked three ways of looking and put
"diff against another implementation" first, because a comment cannot falsify
itself. Reading two *other* agent-facing APIs found this in an afternoon, and
neither the corpus (§B8) nor WPT (§B12) would ever have found it: the page is
conformant, the render is right, and the wrong element is clicked.

### B15.2 The two engines, and what is not comparable

Stated first, so nothing below is quoted against the wrong baseline.

* **Neither is a fair speed or conformance comparison.** Both run V8. Obscura
  ships a 14.5k-line `bootstrap.js` baked into a V8 startup snapshot; Lightpanda
  hand-writes its DOM in Zig against V8 directly. We run Boa, an interpreter,
  for the reason §B11.1 gives. None of the three numbers bounds another.
* **Neither has our reach.** §B11.3 named this as an advantage never written
  down; it survives contact with two more engines. Obscura's SSRF gate denies
  loopback and RFC1918 *by default* (`client.rs:573`, installed as reqwest's own
  DNS resolver), which is the correct default for a scraper and the exact
  opposite of what a coding agent needs. Ours allows loopback by default because
  loopback is the dev server (`--no-loopback` takes it away).
* **Neither has receipts**, and the shape of what they do have is instructive.
  Obscura's CDP `Network.*` events are **batched and emitted after navigation
  completes**, reconstructed from a stored list; anything watching requests live
  sees a compressed, out-of-time picture. That is the failure mode §7.1
  predicted for any engine observing its own network from beside it rather than
  being it.

What *is* comparable is the verb surface: **8 session verbs here, 27 in
Lightpanda, 36 in Obscura.** That gap is not padding. It is the difference
between an agent that finishes a task and one that stalls and re-snapshots.

### B15.3 One verb table, and why it is a security change

Our verb set is written out three times and nothing makes the three agree: the
clap `SessionVerb` enum (`main.rs:239`), a hand-built JSON payload in
`session()` (`main.rs:~470`), and a string `match verb` (`stream.rs:715`).

Lightpanda's answer is the single best structural idea in either codebase. One
exhaustive `Tool` enum (`tools.zig:229`), and every per-tool property is an
**exhaustive switch** on the tag: `isRecorded`, `isAsync`, `needsLocator`,
`producesData`, `waitsForReadiness`, `navigatesToUrl` (`tools.zig:261-330`).
Adding a tool is a compile error until every consumer has made an explicit
choice. Four front-ends read that one table: MCP, LLM tool-calling, a slash
command REPL, and script replay. In Rust this is free.

Here it is not only tidiness. **LOGIN mode's refusal is a string allowlist**
(`stream.rs:711`):

```rust
if session.login && !matches!(verb, "status" | "login") {
```

The default is refusal, so the failure direction is safe, and a *new* verb is
refused until someone thinks about it. But the allowlist itself is two string
literals: one typo opens a read path during credential entry, and no test that
does not already know the typo will catch it. As a predicate on the enum
(`fn readable_during_login(self) -> bool`) it cannot be typoed, and the
exhaustive match forces every future verb to answer the question.

Do this first. Everything after it is cheaper once it exists, and §B15.10's MCP
decision stops being expensive to reverse.

### B15.4 Two handle types, because one of them has to be recordable

Both engines mint durable handles; ours are ordinals (§B15.1).

**Lightpanda has both kinds, deliberately.** `backendNodeId` is a registry keyed
on **DOM node pointer identity** (`cdp/Node.zig:38`), so an id survives arbitrary
mutation and resolves to the same element or to nothing. On navigation the whole
registry is reset, because every pointer in it dangles. That is the cheap
intra-page handle.

The durable one is `SelectorPath` (`browser/SelectorPath.zig:53`): the *simplest
CSS selector whose first match is the target*, built greedily from the target
outward, prepending an ancestor segment only when it shrinks the match count,
preferring `#id` then `[data-testid]`/`[name]` then a `:has()` distinguisher
found by BFS, and only then falling back to `:nth-of-type`. Each candidate is
verified with **the same query function `click` and `fill` use**, so the
selector is correct by the same resolution rule that will later resolve it.

Obscura's approach is the one to refuse: it writes `data-obscura-ref="e3"` into
the DOM (`obscura-mcp/src/lib.rs:1217`) and resolves via an attribute selector.
Cheap, and wrong for us — a receipts engine that mutates the page has a snapshot
that no longer describes the page as served.

Why two kinds rather than the better one: **the durable handle is what makes a
session replayable**, which is §B15.9. Lightpanda shapes its API around this and
says so to the model, in the guidance it ships with the protocol: *"NEVER pass
backendNodeId to click/fill/hover/selectOption/setChecked … backendNodeId calls
cannot be recorded as reusable JavaScript, so any session that uses them is not
replayable."* The recordability constraint is made visible in the API rather
than discovered at save time.

### B15.5 Waiting: the primitive we already have is the better one, and it is not exposed

We have **no `wait_for` at all**. On a script page an agent's only option is
snapshot-and-hope.

Both engines converged on the same default from opposite directions, and it is
worth recording because it is counter-intuitive: **do not wait for network idle
by default.** Lightpanda waits for `load` and says why — *"on real sites
trackers/timers keep the network from ever fully idling, so it just rides the
timeout"* (`tools.zig:1972`). Obscura had to drop its CDP default all the way to
`domcontentloaded` because full-load pushed github.com and reddit.com past the
25s mark while clients timed out at 15s (`domains/page.rs:~1030`). Idle is an
explicit escalation in both.

Our `Settled { elapsed_ms, timers_run, cut_off, pending_timers }` on a **virtual
clock** is a better primitive than either, and this file has never said so.
Theirs are wall-clock heuristics with hardcoded fudge. Obscura's adaptive settle
(`obscura-js/src/runtime.rs:1989`) is the most sophisticated version and carries
a 150ms quiet window, a 1000ms external-work grace, a 500ms observable-activity
tail, a 5000ms synchronous-task floor, and a hardcoded 5s idle deadline that
**marks the page `NetworkIdle` even when the deadline is what ended the loop**
(`page.rs:2691`). Ours is deterministic, reproducible across runs, and costs a
page's `setTimeout(1000)` nothing.

It is also *more complete than theirs on the axis their heuristics exist to
approximate*: our fetch is synchronous underneath, so there is no in-flight
request for a settle to miss. The thing they are estimating, we know.

What to build: `wait_for {selector | text, timeout}` and `wait_for_script
{expr}`, driven by the existing settle loop, plus one borrowed rule from
Lightpanda's wait predicate (`Runner.zig:287`) — **resolve when there is nothing
left to wait *on*, even if the requested milestone never arrived**, rather than
spinning to the timeout. And keep reporting, never guessing: a wait that ended
because the page went quiet without the condition holding is a different answer
from one that timed out, and both are different from success.

### B15.6 Errors that name the recovery

A refusal here is `{"ok": false, "error": "<prose>"}`. Both engines converged on
named codes plus a recovery sentence, addressed to the reader that is actually
there. Lightpanda's (`tools.zig:762`):

```
NodeNotFound: the selector or backendNodeId matched nothing on the current page.
Re-inspect the page (tree/interactiveElements) for fresh node ids, or omit
backendNodeId to target the document root.
FrameNotLoaded: no page is loaded — call goto (or pass a url) first.
```

Three things to take:

1. **A `code` field** beside the prose, so a caller branches without parsing.
   Obscura is the counter-example: every handler error becomes CDP `-32601`
   regardless of meaning (`dispatch.rs:539`), and every page failure collapses
   into `PageError::NetworkError(String)` — timeouts, DNS, SSRF blocks and
   robots.txt denials are one variant. An agent cannot branch on that.
2. **In-band versus protocol failures.** A selector that matched nothing in an
   `extract` is content the model should read and fix; a policy refusal is a
   protocol error. Lightpanda splits exactly there (`mcp/tools.zig`), and
   returning the first as an error kills the self-correction loop.
3. **Pre-parse diagnostics** that name the offending field and list the valid
   values (`diagnoseArgs`, `tools.zig:2060`): `state: "fast"` should produce
   *"invalid state 'fast'. Expected one of: load, domcontentloaded, …"* rather
   than a raw parse failure.

One small accommodation worth copying verbatim: Lightpanda treats
`backendNodeId: 0` as omitted, because zero-filling models send `0` for unset
(`tools.zig:2098`).

### B15.7 The verbs that are missing, and the one nobody else can have

Ranked by how often an agent loop stalls without them: `select_option`, `press`
(a key), `set_checked`, `back` / `forward` / `reload`, `get_attribute`, `count`,
`find_element {role, name}`, `links`, `console`.

And then **`requests`**, which is ours alone. Exposing the request log through
the control channel is a verb no other engine can offer honestly, because no
other engine *is* the HTTP client. Lightpanda has no equivalent. Obscura's is
the batched, after-the-fact reconstruction of §B15.2. Ours is the decision
record that was written before the bytes moved, and the agent driving the page
should be able to read it without leaving the session.

This is the same argument §12 made for the engine existing at all, arriving at
the verb layer. It also closes a gap in the agent's own loop: today an agent
that wants to know whether its click caused a request has to be running with
`--script` and read the `requests` field of the click reply, or go find the
receipts file.

### B15.8 Extraction, and a markdown view

Both engines have a selector-to-JSON extraction DSL and both have markdown.
Ours has neither, and the token economics of an agent loop say both matter.

Lightpanda's `extract` is the better design (`tools.zig:917`): field name to
selector, `[...]` for all matches, `{"selector":…, "attr":…}` for an attribute
with `href`/`src` resolved absolute, `[{selector, fields:{…}}]` for one object
per match with relative sub-selectors, and `limit`. One rule is worth copying
exactly: an empty array is a valid result, but **if every top-level key comes
back null it throws**, in-band, with

```
extract: no schema selector matched any element — inspect the page with
tree/markdown and retry with corrected selectors
```

An unmatched schema is a mistake the model should be told about; an empty result
set is not.

Markdown is a denser read than the a11y outline for the "read the untrusted web"
case that is this engine's stated purpose, and it is cheap over the Blitz DOM.
Note the two gaps in Obscura's converter (`obscura-js/src/markdown.rs:7`) so we
do not reproduce them: no GFM header separator row is ever emitted, so its
tables are not valid markdown, and ordered-list items all render as literal
`1. `. Whatever we emit, the fence of §12.1 applies to it unchanged.

### B15.9 Credentials by indirection, which is the answer LOGIN mode is not

Lightpanda's `$LP_*` scheme is the strongest single idea in either engine for
our threat model, and it is better than what we have.

End to end: only the `LP_` namespace is readable (`tools.zig:2166`); `getEnv`
with no argument returns **the names, never the values**; substitution happens
*inside the browser process* so the secret never enters model context; `fill`
echoes the **placeholder** back in its result rather than the value
(`tools.zig:626`); and the recorder reverse-substitutes on every append,
iterating by value length descending (`tools.zig:2221`) so a short secret that
is a substring of a longer one cannot leak a suffix. There is a test asserting
a prompt-injected `fill('$SECRET')` cannot exfiltrate a non-`LP_` variable.

This matters more here than there, because **it has no hole and LOGIN mode
does.** §12's LOGIN mode is honest about being half built: it refuses the
documented read path but does not withhold frames, and the README says plainly
that an agent that goes looking can attach to the viewer socket and watch the
same pixels. There is no moment in the indirection scheme when the secret is on
screen, so there is nothing to watch.

It also fits the rule the cookie jar already follows. `session status` reports a
cookie *count* and never a value; the request log records how many cookies
crossed and never which. A credential used by name and never by value is the
same rule at the input side, and the receipt can say `used $H5I_ACME_PASSWORD`
without that being a credential in every export the receipt reaches.

The two compose rather than compete. LOGIN mode stays for interactive OAuth this
engine cannot drive at all (and §B11.6's iframe/popup conflict is still
unsettled and still has to be decided in writing). `$H5I_*` covers form posts,
which is most of what an agent meets.

### B15.10 The moat: a recording that replays deterministically

Lightpanda records every state-mutating verb into replayable JavaScript
(`script/Recorder.zig`), with three mechanisms worth taking: an emit-once
preamble; a one-step rewrite window that downgrades a preceding `goto` to
`domcontentloaded` when the next command supersedes the wait; and secret
scrubbing on every append. Recording is *filtered* — a verb that used an
ephemeral handle is dropped, so an unreplayable session simply produces a
shorter script rather than a broken one.

We already write `$H5I_BROWSER_ACTIONS`, and §12.1 already makes the guarantee
that each verb is recorded before it runs and again after. Making that log
**replayable** is a small step from where it stands, and it buys something
neither engine can have:

**Our settle runs on a virtual clock, so a replay is deterministic.** Both of
theirs are wall-clock, so a replay is a re-run with different timing and a
different answer. A recorded run, plus the request log it produced, plus a
replay that lands identically, is a browser session that can be **re-executed
and diffed**. That is the browser-side form of what §B11.5.16 wants from
receipts — an artifact checkable by someone who does not trust the binary that
wrote it — and it is a stronger position than any benchmark table, for the
reason at the top of this file.

It depends on §B15.4. A recording made of ordinals replays into a different
page; a recording made of verified selectors replays into the same one.

### B15.11 Two decisions to make deliberately, not discover

**MCP.** §B11.4 decided against it: the agent runs in the same box, and
`h5i-browser-light session snapshot` is already a tool it can call, so a
protocol server would wrap the CLI in a socket for a caller that can already
call the CLI. That argument is unchanged and still correct **for h5i's own
boxed agent**. What the comparison adds is that both of these engines ship MCP
as their *primary* agent surface, so it is also how anything outside h5i would
ever drive this engine. The recommendation is to keep the decision and note
that §B15.3 defuses it: with one verb table carrying schemas, an MCP server is
a few hundred lines over it. The reopening condition at §B11.4 stands as
written.

**CDP.** §B11.5.4 ranks a subset third, and Obscura is a detailed and
discouraging cost estimate. The protocol is the small part; the compatibility
is the work. Distinct session ids per attach because a target can carry two
client sessions (`dispatch.rs:239`); `canAccessOpener` in every `TargetInfo` or
chromiumoxide panics; rewriting the main document's `requestId` to the
`loaderId` because Puppeteer identifies the navigation response that way, *and*
aliasing the stored body so `getResponseBody(loaderId)` resolves; a required
event ordering with `requestWillBeSent` before `frameNavigated`; execution
context ids cleared and reseeded per navigation, with an invented
`__puppeteer_utility_world__` if the client registered none. Each of those is a
client bug worked around, not a protocol feature.

And the failure mode is exactly the one §B11.5.5 predicted, in the shipped code:
`DOM.setAttributeValue` and `DOM.removeNode` are **silent no-ops**
(`domains/dom.rs:222`), and `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` returns **synthetic
geometry** — every node a 1280x18 box stacked vertically (`domsnapshot.rs:232`)
— in a build where real layout exists a call away. An agent framework that
trusts those bounds gets garbage and is told nothing. That is the `missingApi`
lie at protocol scale, and it is what a partial CDP costs when the conformance
list is not published first.

Recommendation: CDP moves *behind* the agent-loop work in §B15.12, and if it is
built, the conformance list ships before the endpoint does.

### B15.12 What not to copy

**Obscura's stealth stack**, in full. Half of `bootstrap.js`'s fingerprint layer
is a seeded PRNG producing plausible-but-false GPU strings, canvas noise,
battery levels and heap sizes, plus a `Function.prototype.toString` patch that
masks itself and a `getOwnPropertyNames` filter that hides its own globals. It
is competent and it is the exact inverse of this engine's thesis: every one of
those is a plausible lie a page cannot detect, engineered so it cannot be
detected. We are not evading anyone, and a receipts engine that spoofs its own
identity has given up the argument.

The **catalogue** is worth keeping in one direction only. It is a list of what
pages actually probe for, and a page reading `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info` or
enumerating `navigator.plugins` is telling us something about itself. That
belongs in `unsupported()` as a routing signal (§B8.4), which is machinery we
already have.

Also not to copy: **`DOM.setAttributeValue` as a no-op** and **synthetic
DOMSnapshot geometry** (§B15.11); **writing refs into the DOM** (§B15.4);
**batched network events** (§B15.2); and Obscura's documented-but-absent
`localStorage` persistence, where dropping the JS isolate on every navigation
means web storage does not survive a same-origin navigation, let alone a
restart, while `docs/Persist-cookies-and-storage.md` promises a file. §B6 already
commits us to in-memory storage; the lesson is that the *documentation* has to
say so.

### B15.12a The performance items, measured: two noes and one that was refused twice before it was built

§B11.5.13 and §B11.5.14 list two performance items — reuse the realm across
navigations, and cache the prelude's bytecode. Both were attempted. The first
must never be built; the second was built in August 2026 and is the largest
single saving this engine has taken. A third optimisation that looked obvious
was measured and reverted. Recorded together because the pattern is the point,
and the pattern turned out to cut both ways.

The prices moved while this section was being wrong about them. The realm was
~20 ms a page when this was written, ~63 ms by the time it was re-examined, and
is ~15 ms now. The prelude was three thousand lines and is ten thousand. §B8.9
carries the current numbers.

**Realm reuse: refused, on grounds §B11.5 did not weigh.** A realm carries
everything the previous document's script put in it — globals, patched
prototypes, retained closures. Reusing one across a navigation means a page can
set attacker-controlled state, cause a navigation, and have that state visible
to the document it navigated to. That is a boundary this engine would be
removing to save twenty milliseconds. Obscura, a far larger engine in the same
space, drops and recreates its entire JS runtime on every navigation for exactly
this reason, and says so in the code. The note now lives on `Page::run_scripts`
so the item is refused in review rather than re-attempted.

**Prelude bytecode caching: built, 2026-08-29, and this section had two reasons
for refusing it that were both wrong.** Kept in full, because being wrong twice
in the same place about the same thing is the useful part.

The first reason was that `boa_engine::Script::parse` interns identifiers into
the context's own interner and binds the result to that context's realm, so a
parsed script is not a portable artifact. True of the *parse*, and irrelevant to
the artifact: by the time compilation is done a `CodeBlock` holds no `Sym` at
all. Its constants are `JsString`, `Gc<CodeBlock>`, `JsBigInt` and `Scope`, and
nothing in it can reach an interner. The claim was made about the input and
believed about the output.

The second reason, added when this was re-examined on Boa 0.22, was that a
`CodeBlock` owns its `InlineCache` entries and reusing one across realms would
carry the last page's object shapes into the next page's property lookups.
Also wrong, and checkably so: a `CacheEntry` holds a **`WeakShape`**, and a
lookup compares it by address after upgrading it. An object in the next realm
has that realm's shapes, so it can never match an entry left by the last one;
a dead entry is dropped on the next lookup rather than hit. There was no
contamination to prevent. What does accumulate is the `megamorphic` flag, which
is permanent, so code reused across many realms would eventually stop caching
altogether — a performance decay, not a leak, and fixed by the same one-line
reset that was proposed for the wrong reason.

What made it buildable was the owner's ruling that a minimal Boa fork is
acceptable where a vendored in-tree engine crate (§B22, stylo) is not. The
fork carries one commit: `Script::bind_to_realm`, which returns a script sharing
this one's compiled code but running in another realm, with the inline caches
cleared and fresh `[[LoadedModules]]`. It refuses a script whose top level
declares `let`, `const` or `class` — those become bindings the compiler
addresses by *position* in the scope of the realm it compiled against, so a
second realm's scope would not have them. Top-level `var` and `function` are
instantiated by name on the global object and are portable. The prelude is one
IIFE and declares nothing at the top level at all, which is why it qualifies.

**The isolation this does not touch.** The realm refusal above stands unchanged,
and the distinction is the whole safety argument: instructions are shared,
state is not. Every page still gets its own realm, its own global object, its
own prototypes and its own module map. `a_realm_shares_the_preludes_code_and_
none_of_its_state` asserts it from the page's side and the fork's own
`what_one_realm_does_to_the_shared_code_is_not_visible_to_the_next` from Boa's.

Worth 67 ms of the 83 a realm cost, taking it to ~15 ms, and taking a
ten-section scripted page from 72 ms to 26 ms. §B8.9 carries the phase table and
the two costs that did not go away: the first realm on a thread still pays the
whole compile, and building a context on a warmer GC heap costs ~3 ms more than
it did.

**Who this helps, stated plainly, because it is not everyone.** The saving is
per *thread*, and a renderer serves a session's navigations on one. So a session
pays the compile on its first page and never again, and every number above is
that second-page-onward case. A one-shot `h5i browser read <url>` builds one
realm in a fresh process and is not helped at all — it pays exactly what it paid
before. Making the first page cheaper is a different problem, and it is the one
below.

### B15.12b The compile moved into the navigation's own wait, 2026-08-29

The first realm on a thread still paid the whole 67 ms, and a one-shot
`h5i browser open` never has a second. That compile is now paid while the
navigation's own request is in flight: `Broker::send_while` hands the renderer's
idle window to a caller with something to do, and `BrokerClient` writes the
request, runs the work, then blocks on the answer. The broker is a separate
process, so that window is real. It is a reordering rather than parallelism —
Boa's heap is thread-local and `Gc` is not `Send`, so the compile can never go
to a worker thread.

**It is speculative, which is the whole difficulty.** The decision comes before
the document exists, so it cannot ask whether the page has script, and a page
with none builds no realm and would have paid nothing. `worth_warming` asks the
two things it can know: scripting must be on, and there must be a wait to hide
the compile in.

**Measured before building.** Over the corpus, 64 pages: 92% run script, and the
scriptless ones fetch *slower* than the scripted ones — 117 ms at the fastest
against a ~67 ms compile. Not one page lost, and the compile would have to
nearly double before one did. Six pages were dropped as bot-challenge responses,
which are not the page, arrive fast, and carry their own script, so they land as
false wins in exactly the region that decides this. Every page measured was
remote, so loopback and the non-network schemes are excluded in code rather than
assumed to behave like the rest.

**Measured after, and the first answer was wrong.** An end-to-end A/B of two
binaries said 171 ms saved. That is more than the compile being hidden, so it
could not be the change, and it was not: `before` and `after` ran back to back on
the same URL, handing the second warm DNS, a resumable TLS session and a warm
CDN. With the order alternating, the eight-page median fell to **−6 ms** — the
effect is 67 ms against pages that take 0.9 to 39 seconds and swing by hundreds
of milliseconds, so it simply is not resolvable there.

It is resolvable on pages fast enough to show it. Three pages under 1.5 s, 20
repetitions, order alternating, **59 paired runs**:

    after faster in 44/59            sign test p = 0.0001
    median delta                     +106 ms
    95% bootstrap CI                 [+53, +139] ms
    predicted (the compile hidden)   +63 to +82 ms

The interval excludes zero and contains the prediction. The point estimate sits
above the ceiling, which is what a wide interval on a noisy box looks like
rather than a saving larger than the thing being saved.

**The bug this shipped with, because it is the more useful half.** Warming
before a realm exists inverted the order in which two thread-locals are first
touched — the template's and Boa's GC heap — and the template then dropped `Gc`
handles into a heap already torn down. The symptom is not a wrong answer:
everything succeeds, and the process aborts as the thread ends with
`tcache_thread_shutdown(): unaligned tcache chunk detected`. Every test passed
on the commit before, because building a realm touches Boa's heap first and the
order happened to be safe. The fix is `ManuallyDrop`, so the thread-local has no
destructor and the order cannot matter.

Three things about it are worth keeping. Rust does not specify thread-local
destructor order, so anything holding a `Gc` in one **must not be dropped** —
this is a rule, not an incident. A latent crash can hide behind a green suite
when the failure is in teardown rather than in the work. And it was found only
because a test was written for the *link* the wall clock could not measure;
the measurement that could not see the win did not see the crash either.

**And the one that looked free was measured and was not there.** The settle loop
made *five* separate `context.eval` calls per round, three of them on the hot
path and one building its source with `format!`. Combining the three into a
single prelude hook is obviously less work, so it was built — and then measured
against the corpus, three runs each way:

    before   9.87s  9.62s  9.66s
    after    9.86s  9.82s  9.93s

No gain, inside noise, possibly worse. Parsing a twenty-character string is not
what a page load costs, and the change added a packed-integer protocol between
Rust and JS for nothing. Reverted.

The lesson was §B8's own, arriving from the other direction: **the rule against
building what no page asked for applies to performance too.** All three were
reasoned from the shape of the code rather than from a measurement, and all
three were wrong — two dangerous, one merely useless.

**The lesson now has a second half, and it is the more expensive one.** The
refusals were reasoned from the shape of the code too, and one of them was
wrong for six months. Both of its stated reasons named a specific structure —
the interner, the inline caches — and neither was checked against that
structure; `CodeBlock` has no interner reference and `CacheEntry` holds a weak
shape, and thirty minutes of reading either file would have said so. A refusal
recorded with a plausible mechanism reads exactly like a refusal recorded with a
verified one, and it stops the next person looking. So: **when this file refuses
something for a reason in the code, the reason has to cite the code**, the way
§B8.9's rejections cite their measurements.

The closing claim here was wrong in the same way, and correcting it corrects
the shape of the win too. "The ceiling on this whole area is small anyway: the
corpus runs 35 pages in 9.7s, so a realm at 20ms is about 7% of the total even
if it were free" — the realm was 63 ms by then, not 20, so it was about a third
of that run rather than 7%.

But the corpus cannot show the saving at all, and it is worth being exact about
why. `corpus/run.py` calls `subprocess.run` **once per URL**: every page gets a
process, every process builds exactly one realm, and the first realm on a thread
is the one that pays the whole compile. The corpus should be unchanged, and if
it ever *improves*, something is sharing a process between pages that should not
be. The yardstick for this change is a session — `h5i browser open` and then
navigate — where the compile is paid on the first page and by no other.

### B15.13 The queue: built, 2026-08-19

All nine landed, plus `h5i box watch` and the console work of M11c. What follows
is the queue as written, with what each turned into. Three of them produced a
different answer than the one they were specified with, and those are the
entries worth reading.

**Item 1 was a live defect, and the fix is narrower than it looks.** A ref is now
honoured only against the reading it was served in. The check is an equality
test on one ref, not a proof the document is unchanged, and the code says so:
it catches every case where the *handle* has come to mean something else, which
is the failure that was silent, and claims nothing more. Typing and scrolling
renumber nothing, so the login loop still runs without a re-read between steps.

**Item 3 turned out to be a different feature than specified.** Because the
settle runs on a virtual clock *and* runs to quiescence, a page's own
`setTimeout(1000)` has already fired by the time any verb is served. `wait_for`
therefore does not usually wait — it **answers**, with three outcomes rather
than two: found; not found and the page has nothing left to run, so waiting
cannot change it; not found and the page was still working. The middle one is
the one worth having, and collapsing it into "timed out" would be the same lie
this file refuses elsewhere.

**Item 8's cost was the receipt schema, not the transport.** A socket carrying
four hundred messages could have been honoured by receipting the handshake
alone, and this engine's central claim would then have quietly stopped covering
the bytes after it. Every frame is receipted, written as an ordinary
request/response pair with `WS-SEND`/`WS-RECV` as the method — so the console,
`box watch` and the export bundle all show socket traffic with **no changes to
any of them**. `wss://` and remote `ws://` behind a proxy are refused by name;
SSE reconnection is refused because an engine that silently re-dialled would be
making requests the agent never asked for.

**Item 9 produced three negative results**, recorded in §B15.12a: realm reuse
refused on security grounds the queue had not weighed, prelude caching not
buildable with this Boa for a checkable reason, and an obvious-looking loop
optimisation measured and reverted.

Two things were found on the way that were nobody's item. A **password field's
value was read straight back out by `snapshot`**, so a credential typed by a
human during LOGIN mode was readable by the agent the moment that mode ended —
the mode's whole purpose, defeated one verb later. And the console showed
page-derived text to a person with no fence around it, while fencing the same
text for the model.

Still open, and unchanged: §B11.5.1 (a corpus that needs a login) is now the
oldest thing on this list, and §B15.9's credential work changes what it would be
testing. §B15.10's replay is the natural next build, and item 5's durable
selector was the dependency it was waiting on.

#### The queue as written

Ordered by leverage, not size. Items 1 and 2 make everything after them cheaper.

1. **Snapshot generation counter, and refuse a stale `@ref`.** §B15.1. Small,
   and it converts a silent wrong action into a named refusal.
2. **One verb table with predicates**, replacing the three hand-kept copies, and
   LOGIN mode's allowlist becomes one of the predicates. §B15.3.
3. **`wait_for` / `wait_for_script`**, over the settle loop, with "resolve when
   nothing is left to wait on" and a reported reason. §B15.5.
4. **An error taxonomy**: a `code` field, a recovery sentence, in-band versus
   protocol split, pre-parse diagnostics. §B15.6.
5. **A durable handle** (`SelectorPath`-style, verified with the same query
   function the actions use) reported beside the ordinal ref. §B15.4.
6. **The missing verbs**, `requests` first because it is the one that is ours.
   §B15.7.
7. **`extract` and a markdown view.** §B15.8.
8. **`$H5I_*` credential indirection**, and the receipt line that names a
   credential without carrying it. §B15.9.
9. **Replay**: the action log becomes a script, and a replay is diffed against
   the request log it reproduces. §B15.10. Depends on 5.

Items 10 and beyond are §B11.5's existing queue, minus its two performance
entries, which §B15.12a closes as refused and unbuildable respectively. Nothing here
displaces §B11.5.1 (a corpus that needs a login), which remains the
least-verified thing this file claims — and §B15.9 changes what that corpus is
testing, so it should be built after item 8 rather than before it.

## B16. Lightpanda below the verb line, 2026-08-26

§B15 read Lightpanda's agent surface — the tool table, the recorder, the
selector path, the credential indirection — and its queue is built. This read
is the other half: the engine underneath. The load pipeline, the settle loop,
the network stack, the memory strategy and the protocol servers, read
systematically against our own with both catalogued at the same depth.

Facts to pin first, because they change what the comparison is allowed to
claim:

* **Lightpanda has no layout engine.** What it has is a deliberate fake:
  elements are 5×5 boxes, a node's `y` is its document-order index times five
  pixels, `<body>` is 1920 × 100,000,000, and the comments on
  `contentWidth`/`contentHeight` (`Element.zig:1533`) are candid that the two
  are mutually contradictory on purpose — each axis independently assumes the
  arrangement that *produces* overflow, because under-reporting overflow is
  what wedges measure-then-mutate loops. `Page.captureScreenshot` returns an
  **embedded static PNG** (`cdp/domains/page.zig:23`), and `printToPDF` an
  embedded PDF. That is §B15.11's `missingApi` lie at protocol scale, shipped,
  in the second of the two engines we have now read. Among the three of us,
  real pixels are ours alone.
* **Its settle runs on the wall clock.** A page's `setTimeout(1000)` costs a
  Lightpanda caller a real second; two runs of one page can differ. §B15.10's
  replay-and-diff position rests on our virtual clock and nothing in this read
  weakens it.
* **Its network stack is libcurl** — the multi interface, nghttp2, BoringSSL,
  brotli — with a browser-shaped policy layer on top. It did not write an HTTP
  client, which is the correct decision for its goals and unavailable for
  ours: our client *is* the receipt mechanism.

So the engine-level comparison is lopsided in the opposite direction from
§B15's: there the verbs were behind and the engine was fine; here the verbs
are settled and what the reading found is in the load path. Mostly in ours.

### B16.1 Three costs in our own load path, found by contrast

The method note of §B15.1 repeats: reading another implementation found in an
afternoon what neither the corpus nor WPT would ever surface, because a slow
page is conformant and renders correctly.

**1. We negotiate no compression.** reqwest is built with
`default-features = false, features = ["blocking", "rustls-tls"]`
(`Cargo.toml`), so the `gzip`/`brotli` features are off, and no code path sets
`Accept-Encoding` — the string does not occur in `src/`. Every document,
stylesheet and bundle this engine has ever fetched arrived identity-encoded,
commonly three to five times its compressed size. Lightpanda ships brotli,
gzip and deflate through curl and thinks about it never. Nothing in our design
argues for this; it is not a trade, it is an omission the receipts question
never noticed because a receipt records that bytes moved, not that three times
too many did.

**2. Subresources are fetched one at a time, on the parse thread, over
HTTP/1.1.** `BrokerNet::fetch` (`net.rs:640`) is the whole adapter: Blitz asks
for a resource, the broker blocks on the wire, the handler completes before
returning. N subresources are N sequential round trips, and with the `http2`
feature absent there is no multiplexing to soften it. The Cargo comment states
this as a chosen shape — "a browser that fetches one subresource at a time is
a browser whose receipt order is its request order" — and §B16.2 argues that
sentence defends the claim at the wrong place.

**3. Fonts are re-read from disk on every navigation.** `PageFactory::fonts()`
(`engine.rs:1325`) calls `fonts::load` fresh, which `fs::read`s each candidate
file and builds a new parley `Collection`, and it is called from all four page
construction paths (`engine.rs:1362`, `:1433`, `:1451`, `:1461`) — up to the
24-font budget of files per page load, for a font set that cannot change
between navigations of one session. Unlike item 2 this has no comment arguing
for it. It is bug-shaped: `FontSetup` is not shared because nothing made it
shareable.

Per §B15.12a's own lesson, none of these carries a promised number. Each entry
in §B16.10 names the measurement that gates it; the corpus instrument (§B8)
measures pages end to end and is the right harness, run against the network
corpus rather than local fixtures, since two of the three are network effects.

### B16.2 The preload scanner, and what "serial" actually protects

Lightpanda buffers the whole document before parsing — the same
buffer-then-parse shape we have, so no gap either way there — and then runs a
**preload scanner** first: a tokenizer-only pass over the complete HTML
(`src/html5ever/prescan.rs`, ~200 lines, modelled on Servo's
`dom/servoparser/prefetch.rs`) that reports every `<script src>`, module
preload and the first `<base href>`, so their transfers start before the tree
builder reaches them. The comment beside it names the failure it removes:
without this, N large blocking scripts download serially.

That is exactly our shape, minus the fix. And the receipt argument for keeping
it does not hold at the layer it is made. The engine's claim is **no receipt,
no request**: the decision record is written before any bytes move. That is a
claim about *ordering of decision and dispatch per request*, not about
requests being in flight one at a time. A prescan pass that walks the
document's resource list, policy-checks each URL, writes each receipt, and
only then lets transfers overlap, preserves the claim exactly — the receipt
log becomes the decision order, which it already is. Redirects stay per-hop
policy-checked per transfer, unchanged. What changes is only that transfer N+1
no longer waits for transfer N's bytes.

The mechanical route does not even need Blitz's `NetProvider` to become
async: the prescan primes the broker, transfers run on a small pool (the JS
`fetch` path already runs six in flight through the shared client,
`host.rs:203`), and `BrokerNet::fetch` becomes "join the transfer that is
already running, or start one" instead of "start one now and wait". The same
prescan output also answers `<link rel=preload>` for free.

If the decision goes the other way — serial is kept — then the Cargo comment
should say what it is actually buying, because "receipt order" is not it.

### B16.3 The settle loop: name the page that will never finish

Two rules from Lightpanda's scheduler are worth taking because they are about
honesty, not speed. A task that reschedules itself **never blocks completion**
(`Scheduler.zig:137`: "a task that endlessly reschedules itself would keep the
page alive forever"), and once timer nesting reaches depth ten, further
reschedules stop blocking too (`Timers.zig:20`) — the comment names
`requestAnimationFrame` loops as the common case.

Our virtual clock makes the *cost* of this problem zero — a self-rescheduling
timer burns no wall time — but not the *answer*. A page whose only remaining
work is a self-rescheduling interval rides `SETTLE_BUDGET_MS` to the cut-off
(`script/mod.rs:773`) and every `wait_for` on it answers `budget`: "the page
was still working, so it may yet appear". For an animation loop that is a
plausible lie. The page is not on its way anywhere; the condition will not be
met by waiting; the honest answer is the middle one.

The fix is not to copy `blocks_done` — collapsing "only periodic work
remains" into `quiescent` would be its own small lie, since a repeating timer
*can* change the DOM. It is to detect the state (every pending timer is a
repeat, or past a nesting depth, and no fetch is outstanding) and report it as
what it is: a fourth `end` beside `met`/`quiescent`/`budget`, or `quiescent`
with a named caveat, in the same spirit as `open_sockets`. Which of those two
shapes is right should be decided when it is built; what §B15.13's item 3
established is only that the distinction must not be erased.

### B16.4 The snapshot economy

Lightpanda's semantic tree is aggressively pruned for model context, and three
of its heuristics (`SemanticTree.zig:200-233`, `:524`) transfer directly:

* a **structural role** (generic, list, row, cell, navigation …) whose
  computed name is just its descendants' text concatenated, with no explicit
  `aria-label`, emits no name — otherwise every wrapper div hoists its
  subtree's text and the real text nodes then look redundant;
* a StaticText child whose text is a substring of its parent's name is
  dropped;
* a named leaf-semantic node — link, button, heading — does not walk its
  children at all.

Ours caps at 500 lines and truncates; theirs compresses before it ever needs
to cap. The difference is the difference between a snapshot that fits and one
that fits *and still contains the bottom of the page*. This is measurable in
the corpus harness (outline bytes per page, before and after) and should be.

The second economy is turns, not tokens: every Lightpanda read tool accepts an
optional `url` and navigates before reading, and its model guidance says to
prefer `markdown {url}` over `goto`-then-`markdown` — one round trip where an
agent otherwise spends two. On our side that is a `url` argument on the read
verbs, and with §B15.3's table built it is an exhaustive-match question each
verb must answer rather than a scattering of flag code.

Not taken from the same file: their per-session loading knobs
(`LP.configureLoading` — skip subframes, workers, external stylesheets). We
have no subframes or workers to skip, and stylesheet loading is what makes our
visibility filtering true rather than approximate. If a cheap text-only read
mode is ever wanted, it should be argued on its own, not imported.

### B16.5 Cookies: the PSL is a table, not a service

The `Domain` attribute was refused (§12's cookie narrowings) because honouring
it without a public suffix list lets `evil.co.uk` set a cookie for `co.uk`,
and the stated cost was real: a site that authenticates at `example.com` and
serves from `www.example.com` logs out between requests. §B11.5.1's login
corpus will hit this on its first multi-subdomain target.

Lightpanda shows the missing piece is small. Its PSL is a **generated static
table** compiled into the binary (`src/data/public_suffix_list.zig`, a
comptime perfect-hash set regenerated by a script), consulted for both the
Domain check and SameSite's registrable-domain computation, with the
label-boundary check that stops `attackerexample.com` matching `example.com`
(`Cookie.zig:324`). No fetch, no file, no staleness at runtime. In Rust the
same shape is the `psl` crate or a `phf` table generated in CI.

With that in hand, `Domain` can be honoured under the same fail-closed rules
(reject public suffixes, reject non-suffix boundaries), and the other three
narrowings stay exactly as written: in memory, never readable by an agent,
`Secure`/prefixes enforced. This closes a stated cost without reopening a
stated principle.

### B16.6 The allowlist checks a name; the wire connects to an address

Our policy layer decides on origins — names. Lightpanda's SSRF guard runs at
a different layer: curl's open-socket callback hands it the **resolved
sockaddr**, and the CIDR check runs there (`network/http.zig:240`), which
means a hostname that passes every name-level check and then resolves to
loopback or RFC1918 space is still refused. A name-level allowlist cannot do
that: DNS rebinding is precisely an allowed name resolving somewhere the
policy never saw.

For us the exposure is narrow — inside a box the egress proxy is the
enforcement point, and loopback is deliberately allowed — but the engine also
runs bare, the README's request-log claims apply there too, and "the receipt
says `docs.example.com` while the bytes went to `10.0.0.1`" is exactly the
plausible-wrong-record this file refuses everywhere else. reqwest does not
expose a socket hook, but it does expose `resolve()` overrides: resolve first,
check the addresses against the policy, pin the checked answer for the
request. That keeps check and connection on the same addresses, which is the
property the socket hook provides.

### B16.7 `wss://`, and a reason that was narrower than stated

The refusal of `wss://` says "it needs a raw TLS stream the HTTP client here
does not expose", which is true of reqwest and was quietly generalised into a
property of the engine. Lightpanda gets `wss://` for free because its socket
owns its transport — the WebSocket easy handle carries TLS, ALPN and proxying
itself. The same shape exists in our ecosystem: `tungstenite` over a rustls
stream is a socket that owns its transport, and the front half —
`authorise_socket`, receipt, then dial — is unchanged, as is the per-frame
receipting.

What this does *not* change: a remote `ws://` or `wss://` is still refused
whenever an egress proxy is configured, because a raw socket steps around the
proxy that carries the box's allowlist, and that argument never depended on
TLS. What it opens is `wss://` to loopback (dev servers behind local TLS) and
remote `wss://` on bare-host runs, where today the refusal message blames a
missing capability rather than a policy. Low urgency; recorded because the
stated reason was implementation-specific and the file should not carry it as
architecture.

### B16.8 Notes for the CDP item, still queued behind the agent loop

§B15.11 kept CDP behind the agent-loop work and required the conformance list
to ship before the endpoint. This read adds two notes to that file, one
mechanical and one confirming:

* Lightpanda counts every CDP method it does not implement
  (`cdp_unknown_commands`, `CDP.zig:344`, surfaced in its metrics endpoint).
  That is the conformance list's live complement: the published list says what
  is honestly absent, the counter says which absences real clients actually
  hit, in what volume. If CDP is built, both ship together.
* Its compatibility layer is a catalogue of client bugs worked around — a
  fake startup target because Puppeteer expects one, TCP keepalive instead of
  WebSocket ping because go-rod panics on pings and chromedp logs them as
  malformed, `Page.getFrameTree` shaped for Stagehand — confirming Obscura's
  discouraging cost estimate from the second source. The protocol is the small
  part; the clients are the work.

Also seen and noted, not taken: **WebMCP** (`navigator.modelContext` — pages
declaring their own tool manifests to the browser, surfaced as CDP events).
It is a bet that websites will ship agent-facing tools, and it is cheap for
Lightpanda because its whole surface is protocol-shaped. For us it is a new
inbound channel from untrusted page content to the agent, which is the
boundary this engine exists to harden. Reopen if the corpus ever meets a page
that ships one.

### B16.9 What not to copy, this pass

**Silent canvas stubs.** Lightpanda ships 61 `.noop = true` bridge functions —
`fillRect`, `arc`, `save`/`restore` — so canvas code runs and draws nothing,
silently. §B8.4 already names silent stubbing as the worst state for anything
here. But the comparison does sharpen §B11.5.8 (Canvas 2D, the largest
corpus-demand item): both reference engines fake or stub canvas because
neither has a rasteriser. We have one — the paint path is `blitz-paint` over
vello_cpu — so a *real* Canvas 2D is cheaper for this engine than for either
of them, and when the corpus item is paid it should be paid for real, not with
their stubs.

**The pseudo-layout.** It is their load-bearing necessity, not a model for an
engine that has Taffy. If a skip-layout fast path is ever proposed here, the
`contentWidth`/`contentHeight` comments are the spec for what a fake must
guarantee to avoid wedging real pages — and the fact that the spec is that
subtle is the argument for not building one.

**Wall-clock settling, SQLite-backed persistence, phone-home telemetry.** The
first would trade away determinism (§B15.10's replay position), the second is
§B6's storage line, the third is not what this engine is.

**Missing-API stack traces**: Lightpanda's unknown-property interceptor
records the JS stack of the first occurrence. Our `unsupported()` machinery
already exists and already ranks by count; first-seen stacks are a debug-build
nicety to remember, not an item.

### B16.10 The queue

Every item carries its gate. Per §B15.12a, the performance entries are built
*after* their before-measurement exists, and reverted if the after fails to
move it; the honesty and capability entries are gated by the rule of §B8 —
a page, or a stated claim, has to be asking.

1. **Negotiate compression.** Enable reqwest's `gzip` and `brotli`; decide
   and document what the receipt's byte count means afterwards (wire bytes
   and decoded bytes are different facts; the receipt should name the one it
   records, and arguably both). Gate: network-corpus wall clock and bytes,
   before and after. §B16.1.
2. **Load fonts once per factory.** Share one `FontSetup` across navigations
   of a session. Gate: measure the per-navigation cost first so the record
   has a number; this one is a defect fix regardless. §B16.1.
3. **Prescan and overlap subresource transfers**, HTTP/2 on. Receipts stay
   decision-ordered; per-hop redirect checks unchanged; the prescan output
   also serves `<link rel=preload>`. If refused, rewrite the Cargo comment to
   say what serial actually buys. Gate: a network-corpus page with many
   subresources, before and after. §B16.2.
4. **Name the page that will never finish.** "Only self-rescheduling work
   remains" becomes a reported settle outcome rather than `budget`. Gate:
   a corpus fixture with an animation loop, asserting the answer. §B16.3.
5. **Snapshot pruning**: structural-name suppression, StaticText dedup,
   leaf short-circuit. Gate: outline bytes per corpus page, before and
   after, with a diff review that the dropped lines were in fact redundant.
   §B16.4.
6. **`url` on the read verbs** — navigate and read in one round trip, as a
   verb-table question. §B16.4.
7. **`Domain` cookies over a compiled PSL**, SameSite computed on registrable
   domains; the other cookie narrowings unchanged. Gate: §B11.5.1's login
   corpus meeting a multi-subdomain site — which it will. §B16.5.
8. **Resolve-then-check-then-pin** for bare-host runs, so the address the
   policy checked is the address the socket dials. §B16.6.
9. **`wss://` over an owned transport**, when a page asks; the proxy-bypass
   refusal for remote sockets stands. §B16.7.

Nothing here displaces §B15.13's two open items: replay (§B15.10) remains the
natural next build on the verb side, and §B11.5.1's login corpus remains the
oldest and least-verified claim in this file — item 7 above is best built
against it, not before it.

### B16.11 What was built, 2026-08-26

Nine capabilities, in one pass, plus §B15.10's replay which this work made
buildable. What is *not* here is §B16.10's items 1 to 3 — compression, the
preload scan, the font fix — because each is gated on a before-measurement and
§B15.12a's lesson is that a performance change reasoned from the shape of the
code is a change that gets reverted.

**The settle escape hatch produced a fourth answer rather than the copied
one.** Lightpanda's rule is that a self-arming task stops blocking completion;
adopting only that would have folded an animating page into `quiescent`, which
claims nothing can change, and a repeating timer changes the DOM. So `periodic`
is a fourth `end` beside `met`/`quiescent`/`budget`. Two existing tests asserted
the old behaviour on `function again(){ setTimeout(again, 1) } again()` — the
exact shape the hatch exists for — and were rewritten; the "page that never
settles" case they were really testing now uses a timer past the budget, which
is a page that genuinely ran out of time.

**The snapshot work turned out to be a correctness fix, not a token one.**
`text_content()` concatenates a subtree, so a list item wrapping a heading, a
paragraph and a link reported one line reading `TitleBody textRead more` and
then suppressed all three as prose it claimed to have said. It had said them
simultaneously, unreadably, in an outline whose purpose is structure. Scoped to
*block* descendants: `<p>see <a>here</a></p>` and `<h2><a>Section</a></h2>` are
shapes the existing prose rule reads well and neither changed.

**Two of the nine found existing bugs.** `wss://` surfaced that `ws://` and
`wss://` were never mapped to their HTTP twins, so an allowed remote socket was
refused for "could not derive an origin" — a denial whose reason pointed at the
URL when the answer was the allowlist; it had stayed hidden because the proxy
rule refuses remote sockets first inside a box. And Canvas needed a user-agent
rule before anything reached the page: an inline `<canvas>` measured zero by
zero in Blitz, so the drawing worked, the pixels existed, `toDataURL` returned
them, and the rendered page was blank.

**Canvas is the clearest case of not copying the conclusion.** Both reference
engines fake it — Lightpanda with sixty-one silent no-ops — because neither has
a rasteriser. This one does, so what is implemented rasterises through
`vello_cpu` and composites into the page, and what is not reports itself by
name through the same channel as every other missing Web API. That split is the
whole difference between this and a stub, and it is enforced by the bridge
answering `false` for an operation it does not know rather than returning
quietly. The unbuilt operations are *present* rather than absent, which inverts
the usual rule for one reason: canvas drawing is incremental, and a throw on the
fourth of thirty calls loses the other twenty-six.

**`Domain` cookies paid off a stated cost.** §12's refusal was correct while
there was no list; the list is a compiled-in table, so the refusal cost more
than it bought. Four rules replace it, and the one that matters is the label
boundary — `attackerexample.com` may not claim `example.com`, which a bare
suffix test allows.

**The address check strengthens the engine's own claim rather than adding a
feature.** The allowlist decides about a name and the bytes go to an address;
Lightpanda closes that at curl's open-socket hook, and reqwest has none, so the
checked addresses are *pinned* through a custom resolver instead. A name that is
not in the map fails closed rather than being looked up, because failing open
there means connecting somewhere nobody approved.

Also shipped: `--url` on every read verb; a `structured` verb; batch
`open <url>...` sharing one broker, jar and font set; and an unknown-verb
counter, which is the one item here that exists to tell us what to build next
rather than to do something.

**A test was strengthened on the way past.** The skill's "teaches the verbs this
binary has" check matched a bare verb name, so `script` passed on the `--script`
flag and `structured` on the phrase "structured data" — two verbs an agent could
not have found were reported as documented. It now requires `session <verb>` as
a command.

Still open and unchanged: §B16.10 items 1 to 3 with their gates, §B11.5.1's
login corpus, and the §B11.6 iframe/popup question, which none of this touched.

---

## B17. The same-origin policy, and the hole §B16 widened, 2026-08-26

A third reading — Lightpanda and Obscura together, against the engine as §B16
left it — found something neither corpus nor WPT would have: **this engine had
no same-origin policy at all**, and the cookie work in §B16 had just made that
worse.

### B17.1 The finding, and how §B16 sharpened it

The allowlist answers **"may this engine connect?"**. A browser's same-origin
policy answers **"may this document read what came back?"**. Those are
different questions, and only the first was being asked. `Broker::send_from`
checked the allowlist, checked the address, wrote the receipt, and handed the
response body to whoever asked — including page script, for any origin the
operator had granted.

So: allow two origins, and a script on either could `fetch` the other and read
it. The allowlist had said yes, correctly, to the question it was asked.

**And §B16 turned an unauthenticated read into an authenticated one.** While
cookies were host-only (§12's refusal of the `Domain` attribute) a cross-origin
read carried no credential worth having. §B16 added `Domain` over a public
suffix list — right on its own terms, and it paid off a cost §12 had stated —
and in doing so put the session cookie on requests a *different* origin's
script had caused. `net.rs` attached the jar to every request unconditionally.
The combination is a script on one allowlisted origin reading another origin's
pages as the logged-in user.

Neither change was wrong alone. The pair was, and that is worth recording
plainly: **§B16 shipped a capability whose safety depended on a control that
did not exist**, and nobody noticed because each half was reviewed against its
own argument. The lesson is not "be more careful with cookies"; it is that a
credential-widening change needs the question *who may read the response* asked
out loud, and this file had never asked it.

### B17.2 What was built

`src/cors.rs` is the policy, pure and testable; `net.rs` enforces it. The shape
that matters:

* **`Requester` has three cases, not two.** "The agent named this URL" and "a
  page with no origin of its own asked" both look like the *absence* of an
  origin, and collapsing them into an `Option` gives the second the authority
  of the first — precisely backwards. An agent typing a URL has its own
  authority and no boundary to cross; a `file:` page is same-origin with
  nothing. `Agent` / `Document(origin)` / `Opaque`.
* **`send_script` is a separate entry point from `send_from`**, rather than a
  flag on one. The two callers are asking different questions, and answering
  both through one door with no argument between them is how the second went
  unasked for as long as it did.
* **Credentials are the default-safe direction.** `credentials: "same-origin"`
  is `fetch`'s own default, so a cross-origin request carries no session unless
  the page asks for one *and* the server opts in twice — an explicit origin
  echo and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. A `*` with credentials is
  refused rather than honoured, because a server that said "anyone may read
  this" has not said "anyone may read this as the logged-in user".
* **Preflights are real requests.** Policy-checked and receipted like anything
  else, so a caller reading two requests where the page made one is reading the
  truth. Not cached: `Access-Control-Max-Age` would make it cheaper and is one
  more piece of state that can be wrong.
* **A cross-origin redirect taints the origin.** From that hop on the request
  sends `null`, so a server cannot launder a read by bouncing it somewhere that
  answers `*`.
* **Response headers are filtered** to the safelist plus
  `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`, and `*` does not widen a credentialed
  response. `Set-Cookie` is never exposed by name.
* **`no-cors` is sendable and opaque** — status 0, no headers, no body — and
  reported as `type: "opaque"` so a page can tell it from a failure. `no-cors`
  with `credentials: "include"` is refused outright: an opaque response cannot
  be checked, so a credential sent with one could never be shown to have been
  permitted. *Made opt-out by §B24.4: still the default, and
  `--permissive-cors` lifts it for one session, because the refusal is also
  what stopped h5i acting as the victim in a CSRF test.*

Deliberately not modelled: CORB/ORB, which defend a shared process against a
timing side channel. Every document here gets its own realm and the realm is
destroyed on navigation (§B15.12a), so the thing they protect is already gone.

### B17.3 What this does not change

Navigations, subresources and the read verbs are untouched: they run through
`send_from`, which passes `Requester::Agent`, and are unrestricted exactly as
before. The same-origin policy constrains *pages*, not the agent driving them,
and conflating the two would have broken every verb in the engine to fix a hole
in one of them.

### B17.4 Compression, and why the engine decodes it itself

§B16.10 item 1, out of order and without its measurement gate, because it is
not a speculative optimisation: the engine had never sent an `Accept-Encoding`
header at all, so every document, stylesheet and bundle it had ever fetched
arrived identity-encoded. That is an absent capability, not a guess about where
time goes, and §B15.12a's rule was written for the second.

**`reqwest` will negotiate and decode transparently, and that was tried first.**
It strips `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` after decoding — correctly,
since neither describes the body any more — and with them goes the compressed
size, which is the number that says what the request actually cost. An engine
whose claim is that its request log *is* the network rather than an observation
of it cannot delegate that measurement to a layer that then discards it. It is
the CONNECT-gate blindness this engine exists to remove, in miniature.

So the client advertises encodings and this crate decodes them. Both sizes are
measured rather than read off a header, so they are right under chunked
transfer and cannot be contradicted by a `Content-Length` that disagrees with
the body:

    200 GET http://…/ (12426 bytes, 114 on the wire gzip, 2ms)

**And the decoded size is capped, not only the wire size.** A few kilobytes of
zeroes is gigabytes of zeroes; a browser that decoded without a limit would let
any allowed origin exhaust the box's memory with one response. Doing the
decoding here is what makes that cap possible at all — under transparent
decompression the expansion happens inside the client, past any limit this
engine could impose.

An encoding the engine cannot decode is an error rather than a body passed
through undecoded, because handing compressed bytes to the HTML parser renders
a page of binary: a wrong answer that looks like a broken site.

Two of §B16.10's three remain: the preload scanner with parallel subresources
and HTTP/2 (item 3), and the per-navigation font reload (item 2).

### B17.5 A navigation deadline and a per-page network budget

Two bounds this engine did not have, and the reason it did not is the same for
both: **every limit here was per request.** A response size cap, a redirect
count, a per-request timeout — each bounds one request, and none of them bounds
a page that makes many. A script fetching in a loop, each request individually
well-behaved, could keep the engine busy indefinitely, and the receipts would
faithfully record every one of ten thousand of them. Recording a runaway is not
the same as bounding it.

**Per navigation, not per session, and the distinction is about who is
spending.** A page fetching in a loop is untrusted code the engine cannot
otherwise stop. An agent navigating twenty times is the principal exercising its
own authority, and bounding that would be this engine deciding how much work its
own operator may ask for. So the counters reset when the agent navigates: a
fresh page is a fresh decision. A session-wide ceiling on top is coherent and is
not built, because the failure it prevents is a failure of the thing *driving*
the engine rather than of a page inside it.

Exceeding is a refusal, not a teardown. The next request is denied and recorded
as denied with `budget-exceeded`; the page sees a failed fetch, which pages
handle; and the snapshot carries a note, because a page that ran out of
allowance is a page whose reading is **incomplete** — the same class of fact as
"this page had not finished", and an agent that is not told reads a half-loaded
page as the whole one.

**The navigation deadline is the cheap half of "make JavaScript stoppable".**
The expensive half — a killable worker process — was considered and not built:
`Page` holds an `Rc<RefCell<BaseDocument>>` and is pinned to its thread, so
moving script into a separate process means moving the document with it and
splitting the engine in two. That is a large architectural change for a bounded
liveness gap, and inside a box there is already a supervisor. What the deadline
buys instead is that every phase which *is* interruptible now shares one number:
a page that spends thirty seconds on the network does not then get a fresh
twenty to run its script in, which it did before.

It does not bound a single runaway job. Boa checks its cancellation token
between jobs and `LOOP_ITERATION_LIMIT` guards a loop; a job that is neither is
still beyond reach, and saying so is better than implying the deadline covers
it.

### B17.6 Three control verbs, and why `set_checked` is first

`press`, `select` and `set_checked` are the gaps both reference engines have
filled and this one had not: with none of them an agent meets a checkout form,
cannot choose a shipping option, and either falls back to evaluating script or
abandons the task.

**`set_checked` is the one that matters most, and it is not the obvious one.**
Clicking a checkbox is what an agent would reach for, and a click is a
*toggle*: it ends up on or off depending on what the page was serving, so the
same recorded step reaches a different state on a later run. Setting a state is
idempotent, and that is the difference between a replay that lands where the
original did and one that lands somewhere by coincidence. It is the clearest
case so far of §B15.10's rule reaching back into the verb design: the recording
format decided which verb was worth having.

Three details are the engine's rather than the spec's:

* **A radio turns off the rest of its group.** Nothing else here implements the
  exclusivity, and a form submitted with two of a group checked is a wrong
  answer that a page would never have produced.
* **Already-in-that-state is a success and not a change.** The reply says
  `changed: false` and no events fire, or a replay would dispatch a `change`
  the original run never dispatched and a page that re-renders on it would
  diverge.
* **`select` reports and records the *value*, not the text.** The agent read
  the label; the form submits the value. Recording the label would make a
  script that breaks on a redesign that changed nothing but wording.

`press` is deliberately not `type`. One verb whose meaning depended on whether
its argument happened to name a key would be a verb nobody could read, and the
keys that *do* something — Enter, Escape, Tab — are a different act from
entering text. It fires keydown, keypress and keyup, because a page may be
listening on any of the three, and the key is JSON-encoded into the event
because a quote in it would otherwise close the literal and leave the rest as
code.

**The clap invariant test earned its place immediately.** All three verbs take
"a ref and a value, or `--selector` and the value", which is the shape that
broke `session type` in the previous commit — an optional positional before a
required one, which clap refuses at parser-construction time. The test added
after that bug caught all three before they shipped, and the resolution now
lives in one `two_positionals` helper rather than four copies whose error
messages would drift apart.

### B17.7 A role locator, over one accessible-name computation

`find --role button --name "Sign in"` addresses the element a snapshot line
called `- button "Sign in"`, and every action verb takes the same handle.

**The sharing is the requirement, not an optimisation.** A locator with its own
idea of what a button is called would eventually fail to find an element the
outline had just described in exactly those words, and an agent handed two
answers to "what is this called" has no way to choose between them. So
`snapshot::role_and_name` is one function and both callers go through it.

Getting there meant making the computation right, and it was not:

* **Page content beat `aria-label`.** An icon button labelled
  `aria-label="Close"` containing a `×` glyph was reported as `×` — unusable as
  a handle and meaningless in an outline. The author's label is the more
  specific statement and wins, which is what the accessible-name computation
  says.
* **`<label>` beat nothing.** A field named only by its label — the commonest
  shape on the web — was reported by its `placeholder`, or by its `name`
  attribute, or not at all. A label now sits where the computation puts it,
  above the placeholder and below the author's own `aria-label`. One existing
  test pinned the old order and was wrong rather than broken.
* **`aria-labelledby` was not read**, and it is how a control borrows a nearby
  heading for its name.
* **An explicit `role=` was ignored.** `<div role="button">` is a button to
  everything else that reads the page, and reporting it as an anonymous
  container is the engine disagreeing with the author about their own markup.

**And `aria-hidden` turned out to be a fence problem, not an ergonomics one.**
It was not honoured at all. Adding it to the role computation stopped hidden
elements being *addressable*; the text inside them was still printed, because
text does not go through that computation. Content a screen reader is told to
ignore is one of the places instructions aimed at *whatever is reading the
page* get put, and it walks straight past the untrusted-content fence if the
fence never sees it — the same argument the `display: none` filter was already
written from. The whole subtree is now skipped.

Two bugs came out of driving a real form rather than a test. `aria-hidden` is
**inherited**, so checking only the element found a `<button>` inside a hidden
wrapper and called it addressable. And `label_for` used `?` in the walk that
looks for a wrapping `<label>`, which returned from the whole function the
moment it ran out of ancestors — making the `for=` lookup after it unreachable
for every control that was not already wrapped, which is most of them. Both are
tested now, and both are the kind a corpus would not have caught: the page is
conformant and the outline was plausible.

Refusing an ambiguous match is deliberate. Several elements with one role and
name is a page where picking one would be this engine deciding which the agent
meant; the refusal lists the candidates so the next attempt can be exact. And
`--name` matches exactly, because a substring match would make `--name Save`
hit "Save as draft" and "Discard without saving".

---

## B18. The broker/renderer split, proposed 2026-08-27

Status: **steps 1 and 2 built, 2026-08-27. Step 3 is not.** `h5i browser open`
runs two processes now: a broker holding the policy, the wire, the receipts, the
jar, the budget and the secrets, and a renderer holding the DOM, the cascade,
the decoders and the script realm and none of the rest. The seam is
`broker::Broker`; the transport is `ipc`; the renderer's environment is scrubbed
of `H5I_SECRET_*`. Nothing user-visible changed and there is no new subcommand.

**What is still true after step 2, and must keep being said.** The renderer
holds no socket *of the engine's* — and it is not yet stopped from opening one
of its own, because its network namespace is still the broker's. So a
compromised parser cannot read the jar, edit the allowlist, silence the sink or
enumerate the secrets, and it *can* still connect somewhere and not be in the
log. The receipt claim upgrades at step 3, not here. §B18.8 is why step 3 is not
a line in `profile_for`.

The default session sandbox landed first (`h5i-core::browser_sandbox`), and it
sharpened the case for this rather than replacing it. That sandbox contains what
a compromised engine could *do* — its files, its environment, its allocations —
and cannot contain what it could *reach*, because `NetMode` has two values and a
browser needs the one that says yes. This is the change that closes the other
half, and it closes it in the one place the product's central claim lives.

### B18.1 Why the claim needs it

"A request that is not in the log did not happen" holds while the engine is
intact, and only then. The broker that decides and records is in the same
process as the parsers that read the page, so a bug in Blitz, Stylo, an image
decoder or Boa takes the recorder along with the renderer. Today's honest
framing is that this is **the integrity of normal operation, not resistance to
compromise**, and the README says so.

Splitting moves the recorder somewhere the page cannot reach. A renderer with no
socket cannot fetch at all without asking, so the log stops being the engine's
account of itself and becomes an account written by a component the page never
touched.

### B18.2 The line

Not "renderer versus network". **What parses attacker bytes** versus **what
makes and records decisions**.

| | sandboxed renderer | trusted broker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML parse, DOM (blitz-dom) | ● | |
| CSS cascade (stylo) | ● | |
| layout, text shaping (taffy, parley) | ● | |
| image decode, font loading | ● | |
| paint (vello_cpu) | ● | |
| script (boa) and the DOM API | ● | |
| snapshot / markdown / extract / structured | ● | |
| policy: allowlist, redirect hops, rebinding, internal addresses | | ● |
| the wire (reqwest) | | ● |
| the receipt sink, fail-closed | | ● |
| the cookie jar | | ● |
| secret substitution | | ● |
| the control channel and the control lock | | ● |
| the action log | | ● |

The renderer gets no filesystem beyond its own scratch and no network syscall at
all. That is also what tightens the session sandbox: with the renderer holding
no socket, its profile can move from `net.mode = host` to `deny` — an empty
network namespace — which is a one-line change to `browser_sandbox::profile_for`
and the whole reason this ordering is right.

### B18.3 The cases the table does not settle

**Cookies: the gain is narrower than it first looks.** The obvious claim — "the
renderer would see only the non-HttpOnly subset" — is already true where it
matters most: `Jar::document_cookie` returns exactly that, script can neither
read nor overwrite an `HttpOnly` cookie, and `dom_api.rs` goes through it. The
same-origin work in §B17 closed that.

What the split adds is one step further out. Page script is already fenced off
from the jar; the **renderer binary** is not, because the jar is in its address
space. So the gain is against a compromised *engine*, not against a hostile
*page*, and those are different threats with different likelihoods. Worth
having, and not worth describing as though `document.cookie` were leaking
today.

**Secrets: the split has a limit, and it must not be oversold.** Substitution
happens on the way into a field (`stream.rs`, the `type` verb), so the broker
resolves the placeholder and the renderer receives the *value* to put in the
input. A compromised renderer captures it. What the split protects is every
credential that was not typed: today a compromised engine reads all of
`H5I_SECRET_*`, afterwards it reads the ones actually used. Going further would
mean injecting at the HTTP layer rather than the DOM layer, which works for a
form post and not for JS-driven auth. That is the boundary, and it belongs in
the docs the day this ships.

> **Corrected 2026-08-27, on building it.** "It reads the ones actually used" is
> not what step 2 delivers, and the docs say the accurate thing instead.
> `substitute` is an *operation*, so a compromised renderer can resolve every
> name `secret_names` returns rather than only the one it was told to type. The
> narrowing is real and it is about the **set**, not the count: the renderer's
> environment holds no `H5I_SECRET_*` at all, so it reaches what this session
> was granted and not what the machine has — which unconfined is everything.
> "The ones actually used" becomes true when the control channel moves to the
> broker (the §B18.2 table), because only then does the broker know which field

**The asker's origin is the renderer's word.** Found on building it, and it
belongs beside the other four. Half of this engine's policy reasons about *who
is asking*: the loopback rule refuses a page from the open web reaching the
box's dev server, and the same-origin check decides whether the document that
asked may read the answer. Both take the asking document as an argument, and
after the split that argument arrives from the renderer. A renderer that claims
"the agent named this URL" gets the answer the agent would have got.

This is not a regression — the same code chose the origin before the split,
because it was the same code — and it is not fixed by the split either. It is
the shape of a real tightening: the broker knows every document it has served,
so it could refuse to attribute a request to one it never answered with. That
narrows an invented origin to a previously-served one, which is worth having
and is not what step 2 built. Until then, "the broker decides" is exactly true
of the allowlist and the address, and true of the origin rules only for a
renderer that is telling the truth about which page it is on.

**`@ref` resolution stays in the renderer.** Handles are Blitz node ids and live
with the DOM. The broker keeps the *record* of what it served, for the audit. A
compromised renderer accepting a ref it never served buys an attacker nothing:
it does not need to be tricked into clicking.

**Frames stay bytes.** The renderer paints; the broker relays without decoding.
This is already the posture — `termview` decodes JPEG host-side with a
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` decoder precisely because those bytes were made inside
the box — and the split must not quietly move a decoder to the trusted side.

### B18.4 The lane needs a third value

`engine-claimed` and `host-observed` do not describe what this produces. The
broker is not the engine describing itself, and it is not h5i observing from
outside a box boundary: it is a component inside the session's own trust domain
that the page cannot influence.

So a third value — `broker-attested` or whatever survives review — and it should
be named **before** the implementation, because the temptation at that point
will be to call it `host-observed`, which is exactly the upgrade this codebase
refuses everywhere else.

### B18.5 What it costs

An IPC round trip per subresource. The engine already fetches subresources
serially, and the crate's own manifest says why: "a browser that fetches one
subresource at a time is a browser whose receipt order is its request order". So
this adds latency to an existing shape rather than changing it. Worth measuring
before and after; not an architectural objection.

One thing it makes better for free: when the renderer dies the broker knows,
with a status, so a session becomes `died` for a stated reason instead of h5i
inferring it from a vanished process.

### B18.6 The seam, measured

The methods that would cross, from the current tree:

- `fetch`, `fetch_from`, `send_from`, `send_script` — request/response, direct.
- `policy`, `has_proxy`, `budget`, `set_budget_limits` — small, direct.
- `authorise_socket`, `record_socket_frame`, `open_event_stream` — **streaming**,
  not request/response. WebSocket and SSE need a channel, not a call.
- `jar()` — **returns a live reference**, at twelve call sites. This is the one
  that cannot be transported as written; it has to become operations
  (`cookie_header_for(url)`, `store_set_cookie(url, header)`,
  `document_cookie(url)`), which is also what produces the HttpOnly split in
  §B18.3.

Roughly ten operations plus two streams. The files that move or change:
`net.rs`, `wsclient.rs`, `sse.rs`, `script/host.rs`, `engine.rs`.

### B18.6b What the sandbox still lets the renderer read

Recorded 2026-08-27, from a measurement rather than a reading of the code, and
deliberately **not** fixed: the fix is small, invisible, and closes half a hole,
which is the shape of work this section exists to replace.

`browser_sandbox::profile_for` starts from `Profile::builtin`, so it inherits
`default_fs_read()` whole: `/usr`, `/lib`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`, `/nix`,
`/opt`, `/tmp`, `/proc`. Writes are confined (`$WORK` plus the two `/dev`
sinks) and `$HOME` is granted nothing and denies `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`,
`~/.config/gh`, `~/.config/h5i` outright. Reads are not confined in the same
sense. Verified by opening an unrelated `chmod 600` file in `/tmp` from inside
the default sandbox: it renders.

`/tmp` is the interesting entry, because it is where another agent's scratch,
another box's spool and short-lived credentials sit. Dropping it from this one
profile was tried and works — ordinary reads, loopback and public, are
unaffected, and a `/tmp` file that was not the target becomes
`Permission denied`. `$WORK` does not need it: a read's scratch directory lives
under `/tmp` but is granted as its own rule.

It was not taken, for two reasons:

- **It closes half.** Granting only the named local target breaks that page's
  own sibling subresources (`a.html` and its `s.css`). Granting the target's
  parent directory re-grants all of `/tmp` whenever the target is directly in
  it, which is the common case. Only a target one directory deeper actually
  gains anything.
- **Nothing above `/tmp` moves.** `/etc` and `/proc` stay readable either way,
  so "the renderer cannot read files it was not given" is not reachable by
  subtracting entries from this list. It is reachable by §B18's split, where the
  half that parses the page holds no socket and can be given a profile written
  for a process that only parses.

So this is a §B18.7 step 3 concern, not a patch: when the renderer's profile is
*authored* rather than inherited, `default_fs_read` stops being the thing that
decides what a hostile page can read. Until then the honest statement — the one
the CLI already makes — is that the default sandbox contains the engine's
*writes* and its environment, not its reads.

**Updated 2026-08-27, after step 2.** The renderer is its own process now and
this paragraph is still true, because the renderer's profile is *inherited* and
not authored: it is the Landlock domain the broker was already in, which
`execve` carries across unchanged. Becoming a separate process was necessary
and, on its own, not sufficient — see §B18.8 for why the authoring has to happen
outside both halves.

### B18.7 Order

1. **The seam, still one process.** ✅ Built. `broker::Broker` is the named set
   of operations; `net::LocalBroker` is the implementation that does the work
   here. `jar()` became `document_cookie` / `store_cookie` / `keep_only_origin`,
   which is where the `HttpOnly` split now lives. `budget()` returned a live
   `&Budget` and returns an `Allowance` — a reading — because there is nothing
   to borrow across a process. The two streams became one `Channel` trait with
   `send` / `drain` / `close`, which is exactly the surface `dom_api.rs` was
   already using.
2. **Two processes.** ✅ Built. `ipc::BrokerClient` implements the trait over a
   socket; `cli::become_broker` builds the broker, spawns the renderer, serves
   until it exits, and exits with its status. Both halves are internal:
   `h5i browser open` is unchanged and there is no subcommand for either — the
   same conclusion §"The id is not the interface" reached about session ids,
   applied to processes.
3. **Tighten the renderer's profile** to `net.mode = deny`, and add the third
   lane value with the tests that keep it apart from `host-observed`. Not built,
   and not for want of a line: see §B18.8.

Step 1 was worth doing whether or not step 2 followed: a broker reachable only
through a named set of operations is a broker whose surface is written down.

#### What step 2 turned out to cost, and to buy

- **The renderer is spawned by the broker re-execing itself** with a hidden
  `--brokered` flag and the socket as its standard input. An inherited
  descriptor rather than a port (nothing on the machine can connect to it) or a
  path (nothing to clean up). The child's argv is the parent's, unchanged: two
  halves that parsed different command lines would be two engines that could
  disagree about what was asked for.
- **The confinement came for free**, and this was the pleasant surprise. The
  session sandbox already grants read on the engine's own binary — a confined
  `execve` needs it — so the broker can start the renderer from inside it, and
  Landlock's domain is inherited and cannot be relaxed. The renderer is
  confined exactly as the single process was, with no change to
  `browser_sandbox` at all.
- **A dead broker takes the renderer with it.** The reply thread sees EOF and
  the renderer stops, because a renderer that cannot fetch or receipt and whose
  parent is gone is not a browser. Verified by killing the broker of a resident
  session: no orphan, and `h5i browser close` still reads the record.
- **Secrets are the measurable gain today.** `H5I_SECRET_*` is removed from the
  renderer's environment, along with the receipts path, the proxy and the
  allowlist. Substitution is a broker operation, so an intact renderer receives
  the value for the field it was told to fill and holds no other — and a
  compromised one reaches what this session was *granted* rather than what the
  machine holds, which is the narrowing that is actually delivered. See the
  correction in §B18.3: "the ones actually used" waits on the control channel
  moving, and until then saying it would be a sentence this file exists to
  refuse.

  Measuring it turned up that the claim had never been true in the other
  direction either: `--secret NAME` set `profile.secrets` and nothing consumed
  it, so under the default sandbox a named credential never reached the engine
  at all and `h5i browser env` answered "no credentials" for one it had been
  told to carry. `browser_sandbox` now declares `secret_grants` beside the name
  list and `h5i browser` brokers them through `secrets_broker` like any other
  run, on both the confined and the unconfined path — fail-closed is a property
  of the promise, not of the sandbox. `--secret` with `--in` is refused rather
  than ignored: a box declares its grants in `.h5i/env.toml`, and `spawn_in_box`
  never read the flag.
- **Redaction had to become a batch.** It runs over every string in every
  control reply; one round trip per string would have made it the most expensive
  thing the control channel does. `redact_all` is the operation, and the default
  implementation is still the loop.
- **The control channel did not move**, and the table in §B18.2 still says it
  should. It is renderer-side for now, which means the reply an agent reads is
  written by the untrusted half. That is a smaller hole than it sounds — the
  renderer holds the terminal either way — and it is the next thing to move
  after step 3.

### B18.8 Why step 3 is not one line in `profile_for`

The plan said `net.mode = deny` for the renderer was "a one-line change to
`browser_sandbox::profile_for`". It is not, and the reason is worth writing down
before somebody spends an afternoon on it.

The renderer is spawned **by the broker**, and the broker is already inside the
sandbox. Applying a second, tighter confinement from there needs a new network
namespace, and `unshare` and `setns` are both on this codebase's own seccomp
deny-list (`seccomp_deny_program`). The broker cannot make a namespace it is
denied the syscall for. Landlock could be stacked — domains nest — but the
network cannot.

So the confinement has to be authored **outside** both halves, and there are two
shapes:

- **`h5i browser` creates the socket pair and spawns both.** It is unconfined,
  so it can resolve two policies and start two children — the broker with
  `net.mode = host`, the renderer with `Deny` and a profile written for a
  process that only parses (no `/tmp`, no resolver grants, no `/etc` beyond what
  a font needs). It costs the broker its `wait()` on the renderer, which becomes
  an EOF instead — the split already treats EOF as the renderer exiting, so the
  code is there.
- **A launcher handed to the broker.** `h5i-browser-light` gains a trait, and
  `h5i __engine` — which links `h5i-core` — registers an implementation that
  execs the renderer confined. The crate graph allows it (nothing depends on
  `h5i-browser-light` but the binary), and it keeps "the broker spawns the
  renderer" literally true. It does not solve the syscall problem: the launcher
  runs in the broker, and the broker is the process seccomp is filtering.

The first is the one that works. The second is the one that reads better, and
would only work if the broker were left unconfined — which is the wrong trade,
because the broker parses server bytes too (TLS records, headers, gzip and
brotli streams) and wants a sandbox of its own.

Recording this because the honest version of the current state is *"the renderer
is confined exactly as much as the whole engine was, and no more"* — the split
moved what a compromised parser can **reach in memory**, not yet what it can
**reach on the network**.

## B19. Obscura, second pass: the instruments, not the verbs, 2026-08-27

§B15 read Obscura and Lightpanda across the *verb line* and settled what to take
there. This pass reads two things that pass did not have: the engine as it
stands today, which has grown a native rendering pipeline and an MCP server
since; and `obscura-benchmark`, the companion repository that holds every
instrument Obscura measures itself with. `obscura-benchmark` is not mentioned
anywhere in this file, and it is where the useful material is.

The finding, stated first, because it inverts the shape of §B15:

> **The verb-line comparison is closed. The instrument comparison is not.**
> Almost everything §B15 queued at the verb line has been built (§B15.13,
> §B17.6, §B17.7). Nothing has been built against the way Obscura *measures*,
> and that is now the larger of the two gaps.

### B19.1 The two engines, as of today

| | `h5i-browser-light` | Obscura |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | 36,666 lines, one crate | 132,253 lines, nine crates |
| script shim | 5,795 lines (`prelude.js`), Boa | 14,493 lines (`bootstrap.js`), V8 via `deno_core` |
| DOM and CSS | Blitz plus Stylo, assembled | `html5ever` plus `selectors` plus its own cascade (`css.rs` 10,350, `style.rs` 10,924) |
| layout and paint | Blitz plus `vello_cpu` | its own, 66,530 lines: forked `taffy`, forked `cosmic-text`, `tiny-skia` |
| driver surface | 28 CLI subcommands, 20 session verbs | CDP server, 37 MCP tools, `fetch`/`scrape` CLI, embeddable `obscura` crate |
| record of what was fetched | receipts, fail-closed, written before the bytes move | CDP `Network.*` events, reconstructed and emitted after navigation (§B15.2) |
| identity on the wire | one honest UA naming this engine (`net.rs:40`) | `--stealth`: a real Chrome TLS ClientHello, cipher order, and matching `navigator` (§B15.12) |
| default reach | allowlist; loopback allowed, because loopback is the dev server | deny loopback and RFC1918 by default, `--allow-private-network` to opt in |

The size ratio is worth reading carefully rather than quoting. **We are about a
quarter of their line count, and most of the difference is the renderer they
wrote and we borrowed.** Subtract `obscura-render` (66,530) and the two engines
are within a factor of two on the part both projects wrote by hand. That is the
honest framing of "lightweight", and it is a different sentence from the one a
raw line count invites.

The second thing worth naming: **they took the opposite bet on the renderer and
it is not obviously wrong.** Owning layout and paint bought them a `printToPDF`
that is real (`obscura-browser/src/pdf.rs`, 1,027 lines), an activity-driven
screencast, a CDP `Emulation` domain, and geometry that DOM APIs and screenshots
share instead of disagreeing about. Borrowing Blitz bought us all of that
cheaply for the parts Blitz has and none of it for the parts it does not. We
should not re-litigate the choice. We should notice that the *cost* of the
choice is now visible: it is the list in §B19.7.

### B19.2 Their conformance number, and the one instrument worth taking

Obscura reports WPT three ways, from `crates/triage`:

| tier | subtests | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | 318,916 / 382,891 (83.3%) | the DOM/HTML/URL/fetch scraping contract |
| Relevant | 420,319 / 494,422 (85.0%) | Core plus JS-observable correctness needing no layout |
| Full | 503,413 / 839,489 (60.0%) | the whole suite, "for transparency" |

**Do not compare these to our 333,690 (§B13.2).** §B13.3 already withdrew one
such comparison and the reasons it gave apply here unchanged and with more
force: different harness, different corpus, and in this case a denominator that
is not even the same order of magnitude (584,707 against 839,489). Any table
putting the two side by side would be the §B13.3 error committed a second time,
by the same route, with a different competitor.

What *is* transferable is the shape of the report, and it is precisely the thing
§B13.3 said we were missing. Their tiers live in
`crates/triage/src/tiers.list`: 163 lines, one `<tier> <prefix>` rule per line,
first match wins, with a header stating the rule the file is built on:

> The split is by CAPABILITY, not by outcome: a directory is excluded only when
> it needs a capability Obscura intentionally does not implement (layout /
> rendering, a media pipeline, real hardware, or a live network peer), never
> because its tests happen to fail.

That is a **published, auditable, diffable declaration of scope**, and it is the
answer to the problem §B13.3 diagnosed and then solved with a paragraph of
prose. Our caveat ("70% of every passing subtest comes from twenty files") is
true, is correctly stated, and lives only in this document, where it travels
only as far as somebody reading this document. A tiers file makes it structural:
the encoding directory becomes one tier among several rather than a footnote,
and a reader can check the claim by reading a table instead of trusting us.

Two properties of theirs are worth copying exactly, and one is worth refusing:

* **Copy: exclusion is by capability, and the reason is on the line.** A
  directory is out because we do not implement service workers, not because it
  scores badly.
* **Copy: the file is the source of truth for the published number.** A tier is
  not a query somebody typed once.
* **Refuse: three tiers where the third is "everything".** "Full 60%" invites
  exactly the reading their own header warns against. Ours should be scoped
  tiers plus an explicit *unscoped remainder* count, so the denominator is
  always visible and never rounded into a percentage.

For us the tiers would not be theirs. Ours split around what an agent reading a
page actually needs, and §B6's refusals (no iframes, no popups, no workers) are
already the exclusion list, written down years before the instrument that would
use them.

### B19.3 The denominator, and the part of WPT we have decided we cannot reach

`wpt/run.py`'s docstring says it plainly: WPT generates a large share of its
endpoints at serve time, a static server cannot serve them, and the summary
prints how many were skipped so the denominator is never mistaken for all of
WPT. That was the right call for the instrument as built, and §B12.1's reason
for building it that way is still good: nothing was added to the engine to make
it measurable.

Obscura's runner does not accept that ceiling. `scripts/run-wpt.sh` starts
**`./wpt serve`**, the real wptserve, on the real `web-platform.test` hostnames,
after `./wpt manifest` has expanded every generated variant
(`crates/wpt-runner/src/manifest.rs` walks the manifest's variant arrays and
skips only the content hash). That is what puts `.any.html`, `.any.worker.html`,
the `.py` handlers, the HTTPS variants and the cross-origin subdomains inside
their denominator and outside ours.

The reason to revisit this now is not the score. It is that **three subsystems
this engine has grown since §B12 are only testable on that server**:

* §B17's same-origin policy and CORS. Every meaningful CORS test needs a second
  origin, which needs the WPT subdomains, which needs their hosts file.
* §B16.5's PSL cookies. Cookie scoping tests are about `Domain=` across
  registrable boundaries, which is again several hostnames.
* §B17.4's compression. `Content-Encoding` behaviour is served by wptserve's
  handlers, not by files on disk.

So we currently have three of the engine's most security-relevant subsystems
tested by our own unit tests and by nothing external, and the external suite
that would test them is one shell script away. The cost is real and should be
stated: it needs a WPT checkout that is not pristine (a hosts file entry, and
`./wpt serve` running), which is exactly what §B12.1's "pristine checkout"
design chose to avoid. The proposal is not to replace `wpt/serve.py`. It is a
**second backend** for `wpt/run.py`, off by default, so the static instrument
stays the one CI can run and the wptserve instrument is what a conformance
claim is made from.

A second, cheaper borrow from the same runner: it has **two engine backends**,
one process per test (`fetch`) and a persistent CDP connection with a worker
pool. Ours is one process per test only, which is why a full sweep is measured
in hours. The first idea here was to point `run.py` at a resident session, and
it does not survive contact with the code: the harness reads its results out of
`open --json`'s console channel, and a session does not expose console output
per navigation, so that backend would first need a new verb. The next idea was
batching: `open` takes several URLs in one process, one JSON object per page,
with the shared broker's records already sliced per page (`cli.rs:1885`), so N
test files per invocation would amortise process start and font loading and is
a change to `run.py` alone. **That was built, measured and reverted: identical
scores, and 5x slower on `dom`, for a structural reason.** See §B19.12. Both
speedups proposed in this section turned out to be wrong, and neither was timed
before it was written down.

### B19.4 The four instruments they have and we do not

Their benchmark repo has seven tracks. Two of them we already have and ours is
better in one respect worth recording. Four we do not have at all.

**We already have, and ours is better:** the head-to-head against Chromium.
`corpus/compare.py` samples peak RSS across the **whole process tree**, and says
why: Chromium is a browser, a renderer, a GPU process and a zygote, and
measuring only the launched process would flatter us by several hundred
megabytes for no reason. Their `compare/head-to-head.py` reads GNU `time -v`
Maximum RSS of the launched process. Their reported "Chrome 190 MB" is therefore
a floor, not a measurement, and their own `compare/scale.py` (which uses
`psutil`) reports 8.1 GB for eight Chrome workers, which is the same number
measured properly. Ours is the sounder method and it is not written down
anywhere but in that file's docstring.

**We do not have, ranked by what they would find here:**

1. **A reliability sweep with a classifier.** `reliability/sweep.py` does a
   one-level BFS from a seed list to build ~1,500 real URLs, runs the engine
   over all of them at concurrency, and sorts each outcome into
   `CRASH` / `PANIC` / `CAP_HIT` / `HANG` / `HANG_HARD` / `THIN` / `OK` from the
   exit code and stderr. The classes are the point: `CAP_HIT` exists because a
   cyclic reparent once made `descendants()` loop forever, so the guard against
   it has a named bucket in the instrument that would show it coming back.
   This is §B8's own doctrine ("an instrument that cannot name what is missing")
   applied to *crashing* rather than to *missing features*, and it is the one
   thing on this list we have no substitute for. `corpus/run.py` reads 35 pages
   and reports what they asked for; it does not sweep, does not classify, and a
   panic in it looks like a page that failed.
2. **An offline capability suite with vendored frameworks.** `obstacle-course/`
   is 33 self-contained fixtures with React 18, Preact and Vue 3 pinned into
   `vendor/`, each setting a deterministic value the runner asserts, each timed.
   It is their authoritative behavioural gate and `AGENTS.md` requires 33/33
   before any change lands. `tests/corpus.rs` is the same idea and is narrower
   by construction: its fixtures are hand-written reductions of things the
   network corpus found, so it can only ever contain regressions of bugs we
   already had. It cannot answer "does Vue 3 mount", which is a question an
   agent's user will ask on day one.
3. **Failure triage that groups.** `crates/triage` deduplicates WPT failures
   into root causes and prints the top error signatures per spec area. We have
   the raw material for this and already use it: `run.py`'s `unsupported` map
   is exactly this instrument in miniature, and §B12.2's "twenty files, four
   bugs" is what it found. It stops at one directory at a time. Rolling it up
   across a sweep is a merge, and `wpt/merge.py` already exists.
4. **Speed as a tracked number.** Every obstacle-course stage is timed, and
   `AGENTS.md` makes performance a hard constraint with a stated noise floor of
   plus or minus 10% and a required interleaved A/B methodology. §B15.12a is our
   equivalent lesson learned the expensive way, three optimisations reasoned
   from code shape and all three wrong. The lesson it drew was "measure", and no
   standing measurement was left behind.

**One caution about their repo, and it is a lesson rather than a jab.** Its
README opens by stating Obscura "has no rendering, layout, or paint pipeline",
and the results are dated 2026-07-03 against commit `b5039a8`. Obscura's own
README now headlines native rendering, and `obscura-render` is half the
codebase. The instrument's *framing* rotted while its numbers stayed
reproducible. This file has the same exposure at larger scale: §B13.3's
withdrawn comparison is the shape of it, and the corpus harnesses in §B19.5 are
the shape of it in code.

### B19.5 Two harnesses in our own tree are pointed at a binary that does not exist

Checked while looking for our answer to their obstacle course. Both fail to
start, for the same reason, and neither says so anywhere:

* `corpus/run.py:34` defaults to `target/debug/h5i-browser-light`.
* `corpus/compare.py:28` uses `target/release/h5i-browser-light`.

That binary was removed when the engine became a library reached through
`h5i __engine` (see `Cargo.toml`'s comment, and `wpt/run.py`'s docstring, which
records this exact path as "a trap now" and was updated). Both scripts also
invoke `<bin> open <url> --json`, which is the argv the engine still takes.

**Checked again while writing the todo list: the fix is not "the path plus one
argument".** The path is the visible half. The other half is that the engine's
policy now denies every remote origin unless `--allow` grants it
(`Policy::new()` permits nothing but loopback, `cli.rs:703`), there is no
allow-everything spelling (`*.host` is the widest wildcard, `policy.rs:83`),
and the corpus scripts pass no `--allow` at all — they were written when the
engine's default was open. So with the path fixed, every remote page is refused
before the first byte, and per-URL wildcard grants would still refuse the
third-party subresources whose behaviour is half of what the corpus measures.
An instrument that points the engine at the open web needs an explicit,
loudly-named grant — a decision, not a patch, and it is item 1 of §B19.10.

The consequence is worth stating rather than just the bug: **§B8's corpus, the
instrument this document credits with finding most of the engine's real work,
has not run since the self-exec change**, and `compare.py`, the source of every
memory and latency claim about this engine against Chromium, has not run either.
Any such number in this file predates the broker/renderer split (§B18), which is
the change most likely to have moved it.

### B19.6 `--restore` copies a file nothing writes

`h5i browser open --restore <id>` documents itself as seeding a new session's
storage from one that has ended, and `seed_storage` (`src/cli/browser.rs:1903`)
copies `cookies.json` out of the old session's directory. Nothing in the
workspace writes `cookies.json`: `cookies.rs:48` says "The jar lives in the
process and dies with it", and it is accurate. `source.exists()` is therefore
always false and the flag is a silent no-op.

This is §B15.12's own finding about Obscura ("documented-but-absent
`localStorage` persistence, where the documentation has to say so") reproduced
in our tree, at the point where it costs the most: the flag exists to carry a
login across sessions, and §B15.9 and the LOGIN-mode design both lean on a human
authenticating once. Today the human authenticates once per session, forever.

Two ways out, and they are not the same feature:

* **Make the flag honest now.** Either refuse `--restore` with "this session
  never wrote a jar" or delete it. Small, and it stops the promise.
* **Write the jar, receipted.** A cookie file is credential material, so it is
  not a `--storage-dir` in our design; it is a host-owned artifact with the same
  treatment secrets already get (§B15.9's indirection). The shape that fits: the
  jar is written on session end into the session's own directory, `--restore`
  names one definite ended session as it already does, and the inheritance is
  written into the new session's record, which the current help text says
  happens and which is the part of the design that is already right.

Obscura's `--storage-dir` is the wrong model for us and their own
`browser_storage_state` / `browser_set_storage_state` pair is the interesting
one: it is Playwright-shaped, which means a session's authenticated state is a
value an agent can hold, name and hand back. That is compatible with receipts in
a way a shared directory on disk is not.

### B19.7 The verb line, re-counted

§B15.2 counted 8 session verbs here against 36 in Obscura and called the gap the
difference between an agent that finishes and one that stalls. It is now 20
session verbs and 28 CLI subcommands against 37 MCP tools, and the remaining
difference is no longer padding either. What they have that we do not, with what
each is actually for:

| theirs | what it buys | our position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_screenshot` | the agent sees the page it is acting on | **the real gap.** `--screenshot` is on `open` only (`cli.rs:104`); a resident session can only emit JPEG frames to the human's live view (`stream.rs:296`). An agent driving a session cannot capture it. |
| `back` / `forward` / `reload` | undo a wrong click without re-navigating from scratch | we have no history at all. `reload` is the cheap half and is worth having on its own. |
| tabs (`tab_new`/`list`/`switch`/`close`) | one session, several pages | the ROADMAP's own table says tab is agent-facing "when there is more than one page in a session". There is never more than one. |
| `get_cookies` / `set_cookie` / `clear_cookies` | inspect and seed auth | deliberately absent, and it should stay deliberate: handing an agent the cookie is exactly what LOGIN mode exists to avoid. `--dump cookies` including HttpOnly is the version to refuse loudly rather than to have and not document. |
| `console_messages` | see what the page's script complained about | we surface console output in `open --json` and in snapshot notes, not as a verb on a live session. |
| `evaluate` | arbitrary JS | refused, correctly. A verb that runs arbitrary script is a verb whose receipt says nothing. |
| `pdf` | a page as a document | needs print layout, which Blitz does not give us. §B11.5 and §B11.6 already queue it. Cost is now known to be large: theirs is 1,562 lines across two files on top of a renderer they own. |

Only the first three are worth building. The screenshot verb is the one to build
first and it is nearly free: `Page::screenshot_png` exists, the session holds the
page, and the verb table (§B15.3) is where it goes.

### B19.8 Import maps: the page names the destination, so the engine does not have to

`script/modules.rs` refuses bare specifiers, and the reason is one of the better
paragraphs in this codebase: a loader that rewrites `import "lodash"` to a CDN
turns one line of page script into an unrequested request to a third party
chosen by the engine. That is right and should not change.

`<script type="importmap">` is the standard's answer to exactly this, and it
does not have the property the refusal is aimed at: **the page declares the
mapping, so the engine is not choosing anything.** Obscura implements it in
`obscura-js/src/import_map.rs`, 455 lines. Every resolved URL still goes through
our broker, still gets policy-checked, still gets a receipt, and the receipt is
strictly more informative than today's outcome, which is a refusal that records
nothing about where the page wanted to go.

This is the rare item that increases both capability and auditability, and the
refusal it modifies stays intact for its actual target: a bare specifier with no
import map is still an error naming what would have to exist.

### B19.9 What not to copy, second pass

§B15.12 refused the stealth stack in full and that refusal is unchanged and
correct. Three additions, since this pass read further:

* **`--proxy` as a scraping feature.** Obscura's is a per-invocation flag
  pointed at residential proxy pools, and their `AGENTS.md` carries affiliate
  codes for four providers. Ours is `H5I_EGRESS_PROXY`, set by h5i, and it is an
  *enforcement point*, not a route. A CLI flag that lets the caller choose the
  proxy is a CLI flag that lets the caller step around the allowlist that proxy
  enforces, which `net.rs:250` already says in as many words. Keep it as an
  environment variable set by the thing doing the enforcing. SOCKS5 support
  (their `reqwest` has `socks`, ours does not) is the same question and gets the
  same answer.
* **`--user-agent` as a free-text override.** `net.rs:40` shares one honest UA
  between the wire and `navigator`, and the comment gives the reason: a page
  that branches on it server-side and again in script must see the same answer
  both times. An override that changes one and not the other is a bug factory,
  and an override that changes both is the stealth argument wearing a smaller
  hat. If a site gates on UA and an agent legitimately needs past it, the honest
  form is a *named* profile whose value is in the receipt, not a string flag.
* **`--obey-robots` as a boolean.** Their cache answers allow/deny and the
  request either happens or does not. §B15.6's rule applies: a denial an agent
  cannot branch on is a denial an agent cannot recover from, and that section
  already names robots.txt denials as one of the variants that needs a name. If
  we take robots at all it is as a *receipt annotation* first: record that the
  origin asked us not to, on the record, and let policy decide. "The page said
  not to and we did anyway, and here is the line that says so" is a thing only a
  receipts engine can offer.

### B19.10 The todo list, made concrete, 2026-08-27 (second pass)

Rewritten the same day it was first drafted, after checking each item against
the code instead of against the section that proposed it. Two claims did not
survive the check and are corrected above (§B19.3's session backend, §B19.5's
"one argument"). Grouped by shape rather than ranked 1–9, because the first
group is measured in hours and the last in weeks, and a flat ranking hid that.

**Small and immediate — each is one sitting, none blocks another:**

1. **Refuse `--restore`** (§B19.6). One check in `src/cli/browser.rs`: if the
   source jar does not exist — and today it never does — fail with *"session
   `<id>` left no storage to restore"* instead of silently seeding nothing.
   The real persistence work is item 8; this stops the false promise today.
2. **A `screenshot` verb on the session** (§B19.7). `Page::screenshot_png`
   exists (`engine.rs:1277`); the verb goes into the §B15.3 table, which forces
   the two answers that matter: it does not mutate, and it is **refused during
   LOGIN mode** — it reads the page, and the page during LOGIN holds what the
   human is typing. The PNG lands as a host-named artifact in the session
   directory, like every other session artifact; the reply carries the path.
3. **`reload`** (§B19.7). The cheap half of history: re-navigate to the current
   URL through the existing `navigate` machinery. `back`/`forward` are
   deliberately deferred until an agent transcript shows one stalling for lack
   of them — §B8's rule, applied to verbs.
4. **Batch WPT files per process in `wpt/run.py`** (§B19.3, corrected).
   `open` already takes several URLs in one invocation with per-page records;
   the runner change is grouping and splitting the JSON array. No engine work.
   *(Built 2026-08-27, measured, reverted: identical scores and 5x slower on
   `dom`. §B19.12 has the numbers and the reason.)*

**The instrument decision, then the instruments it unblocks:**

5. **An instrument-grade grant** (§B19.5). The corpus and any future sweep need
   the engine pointed at the open web, and the policy deliberately has no
   spelling for that. The options: (a) per-URL wildcard grants, which still
   refuse third-party subresources and so change what the corpus measures; or
   (b) an explicit engine flag — `--allow-any-remote` or similar — that is loud
   in the name, prints on the placement line, and is receipted like every
   grant. (b) is the honest one: the corpus's whole point is watching what a
   page asks for, and an instrument that pre-filters the asks is measuring its
   own allowlist. The flag does not weaken the product default; it names a mode
   the instruments were silently assuming.
6. **Repair `corpus/run.py` and `corpus/compare.py`** (§B19.5). The path
   (`h5i __engine open ...`) plus the item-5 grant. Until both land, §B8's
   corpus is a description of an instrument, and every memory number against
   Chromium in this file predates the broker split.
7. **The reliability sweep** (§B19.4). Same grant dependency as item 6 —
   without it, 1,500 pages of refused subresources drown the classes in THIN.
   Outcome classes for this engine: CRASH / PANIC / HANG / HANG_HARD / THIN /
   OK, plus **REFUSED** — main document stopped by policy — which their sweep
   does not need and ours does, because a refusal is a correct outcome here and
   must not be counted as a failure. Seeds: the corpus lists plus a one-level
   crawl, per their `sweep.py`.
8. **Jar persistence, designed rather than patched** (§B19.6's second option).
   The session writes its jar into its own directory on clean end (0600, owner
   only), `--restore` reads it, and the inheritance line the help text already
   promises becomes true. The design questions to settle before code: HttpOnly
   cookies must be included or a restored login is no login, which makes the
   file credential material — so it gets the scrubber's treatment on any path
   that prints it, and a decision about whether a box-placed session may write
   it at all. `browser_storage_state`'s shape (state as a value, named and
   handed back) is the model, not `--storage-dir`'s (state as a shared
   directory).

**The reporting work — independent of everything above:**

9. **A tiers file for the WPT report, plus the triage rollup** (§B19.2, and
   §B19.4's item 3, merged because they touch the same two scripts).
   `wpt/tiers.list` in their format — one `<tier> <prefix>` per line, first
   match wins, exclusion only by capability with §B6 as the source of the
   exclusions — read by `check.py` and `merge.py`; and `merge.py` learns to
   merge the per-directory `unsupported` maps so the top asks across a whole
   sweep are one table instead of 191 files. Scoped tiers plus an explicit
   unscoped remainder; no "Full" percentage.
10. **The wptserve backend, http-only** (§B19.3). `./wpt manifest` +
    `./wpt serve` behind a `--wptserve` flag on `run.py`, grants spelled
    `http://web-platform.test:8000` and `http://*.web-platform.test:8000`,
    which the wildcard grammar already carries scheme and port through
    (`policy.rs`'s `wildcards`). **HTTPS variants are out of scope and the reason
    is structural:** the engine trusts `webpki-roots` and deliberately exposes
    no way to add a root (the hermetic-build rule), and WPT serves its own CA.
    The http half still covers most of what §B19.3 wants it for — the
    cross-origin CORS suites, cookie scoping across subdomains, and the
    `Content-Encoding` handlers.

**The feature work, in the order the instruments would justify it:**

11. **Import maps** (§B19.8). Parse `<script type="importmap">` before module
    resolution in `script/modules.rs`; a mapped specifier resolves and goes
    through the broker like any URL, a bare one without a map keeps today's
    refusal verbatim.
12. **Offline capability fixtures, timed** (§B19.4's items 2 and 4, merged).
    A handful of stages, not 33: React 18 UMD render, Vue 3 mount,
    SSR-hydrate, and a `pushState` mini-SPA, vendored pinned, each asserting a
    deterministic value through `--json`. Each stage timed, **reported and not
    gated** — a timing gate in CI is a flake factory, and §B15.12a's lesson was
    "measure before optimising", which a report satisfies and a gate does not.

Not queued, decided, unchanged from the first draft: no `--proxy` flag, no
`--user-agent` flag, no cookie read/write verbs, no stealth layer (§B19.9).
CDP and MCP stay where §B15.11 put them; the §B15.3 verb table now exists, so
the MCP estimate is if anything lower than when it was written.

### B19.11 What was built, 2026-08-27

All twelve items were taken. **Eleven shipped and one was measured and
reverted**, which is the outcome that earned its place in this file: item 4 was
reasoned from the shape of the code, built, measured, and was wrong in the same
way §B15.12a's three optimisations were wrong.

**The engine (items 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11).** 576 tests pass, from 552; the 24 new
ones are named below by what they pin rather than by what they cover.

* **`--allow-any-remote`** (`policy.rs`, item 5). The instrument grant, and the
  keystone the corpus and the sweep were both blocked on. It widens the *name*
  check and nothing else, which took one more change than expected:
  `check_address` sends an IP-literal host back to the allowlist, so a blanket
  grant would have become a route into RFC 1918 space by spelling. The
  allowlist match is now split out as `Policy::listed`, and `check_address`
  asks that narrower question. Four tests hold the line: a public name
  resolving inward is still refused, `http://10.0.0.7` is still refused unless
  somebody named it, a web page still may not reach loopback, and the default
  still reaches nothing.
* **`screenshot`** (item 2), the first user of `browser_session::artifact_path`,
  which was written for exactly this and had no caller. h5i names the file, the
  engine chooses only the bytes, and the PNG goes to a path rather than into the
  reply — a base64 image would have been silently truncated at the scrubber's
  256 KiB cap and arrived as a corrupt file, which is the plausible-wrong answer
  this engine exists to refuse. Verified end to end: 19,352 bytes, 1280x720,
  and **refused during LOGIN mode**, which is the answer the verb table forced.
* **`reload`** (item 3), routed through `navigate_to` rather than given its own
  path, so it is policy-checked, drops the served refs, and reports a refusal
  exactly as `navigate` does. `back`/`forward` stay unbuilt: §B8's rule.
* **The cookie jar persists** (`cookies.rs`, item 8) when and only when h5i
  passes `--cookie-jar`. Written on change rather than at exit, because `close`
  and `service_stop` end a session with a signal and a shutdown hook would
  never run; `0600`; temp-then-rename. The flag lives on `NetArgs` beside
  `--receipts`, not on `serve`, because after the §B18 split the renderer holds
  no jar and `local_broker` is the one place both halves reach.
* **`--restore` is honest** (item 1) and now has something to restore. Verified
  the whole way round: log in on one session, close it, `--restore` into a new
  one, and the server sees `sid=s3cr3t`. A session that left no jar is refused
  by name with the three reasons it could be missing.
* **Import maps** (`script/import_map.rs`, item 11). `imports` and `scopes`,
  longest-prefix-wins, values resolved against the document. The refusal keeps
  its exact target — a bare specifier with *no* map still names what would have
  to exist — and the map is read from the parsed tree before the first script,
  so nothing at runtime can move a graph that is already resolving. Ten unit
  tests plus four through the real pipeline, including that a map is never
  executed as script (it is JSON, and running it is the `application/json`
  trap) and that a malformed one is reported and ignored *whole*.

**The instruments (items 6, 7, 9, 10, 12).**

* **`harness.py`** is new and is the actual fix for §B19.5. The bug was not
  three wrong paths, it was that there were three of them; one module now owns
  where the engine is, how it is invoked, and what an instrument is granted.
* **The corpus runs again** (item 6), for the first time since the self-exec
  change. Its hand-built allowlist is gone with it: a site's host, a wildcard,
  and six named CDNs meant a page pulling from a seventh looked like an engine
  failure. First run found real work — `Element.jquery` 826 calls on one page,
  `selector :has()`, `document.compatMode`.
* **`reliability/sweep.py`** (item 7) crawls one level from the corpus seeds and
  sorts outcomes into CRASH / PANIC / HANG / HANG_HARD / REFUSED / THIN / OK.
  **REFUSED is ours and is not in Obscura's sweep**, because a policy refusal is
  this engine working; counting it as a failure would make a narrow allowlist
  look like an unstable engine. First run: 60 URLs, 0 engine bugs, 0 REFUSED.
* **`wpt/tiers.list` and `wpt/tiers.py`** (item 9) do what §B13.3 asked for in
  prose. Run against the August sweep the table says, by construction:
  **core 59,953 passing, encoding 225,786, and the headline is 79% encoding.**
  Nobody has to remember the caveat any more. One thing was got wrong first and
  is worth keeping: the fold was per *directory*, which is wrong for `css` —
  one result file, 75,000 subtests, straddling core (`css/cssom`), excluded
  (`css/css-animations`) and unscoped. Classified as a directory it matched
  nothing and the remainder became the second-largest row in a table whose
  whole purpose is that the remainder is small. It folds per test now, and the
  unscoped remainder is 175 of 2,491 across 111 named areas.
* **The triage rollup** in `merge.py` (item 9) groups failure *messages* by
  shape across a whole sweep. It paid for itself on the first run: 8,425
  subtests failing on one unhandled-rejection shape, 3,460 on `cannot convert
  'X' or 'X' to object`, 2,396 on `not a callable function`. That is §B12.2's
  "twenty files, four bugs" mechanised.
* **`wpt/wptserve.py`** (item 10) runs against WPT's own server, with the real
  subdomains and the `.py` handlers — which is what puts §B17's CORS, §B16.5's
  PSL cookies and §B17.4's compression under external test for the first time.
  The overlay is installed into the checkout and restored in a `finally`,
  including on Ctrl-C. **The https variants are dropped by name**, because
  wptserve serves them under its own CA and this engine trusts `webpki-roots`
  with no way to add a root: a trust decision recorded as a conformance result
  would be exactly the kind of number this harness exists to avoid.
* **`capability/`** (item 12), nine stages, offline, frameworks vendored.
  **9/9 pass**: React 18, Preact, Vue 3 including its runtime template
  compiler, Preact hydration, a fetch+pushState SPA, the modern-language and
  platform surface, timer/microtask ordering, and the import map from item 11.
  Median 169 ms. Timing is printed and **not gated** — a latency gate in CI is
  a flake factory, and §B15.12a asked for a measurement, not a tripwire.

### B19.12 Item 4, measured and reverted, which is the useful half

Batching WPT files into one engine process was the "speedup that needs
nothing": `open` already takes several URLs and slices its records per page, so
twelve files per process would amortise process start and font loading. It was
built, and it produced **identical scores** and was slower nearly everywhere.

| directory | files | one per process | batched (12) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dom` | 587 | **75.3s** | 392.0s |
| `css/cssom` | 190 | 22.8s | **20.5s** |
| `domparsing` | 60 | **2.6s** | 3.1s |
| `url` | 34 | **1.7s** | 2.2s |

`dom` settles it, and the cause is structural rather than a matter of tuning:

* **A batch shares a process, so a batch that crashes loses every file in it.**
  Correctness therefore requires re-running a failed batch one file at a time —
  and WPT is a corpus where crashing and hanging files are common, so on `dom`
  most batches split and most files ran twice.
* **Batching takes the harness's per-file timeout away.** The ceiling becomes
  per-process, so one hanging file holds eleven others instead of being killed
  on its own worker while the rest proceed.
* **The ceiling was never large.** `dom` runs at about 7.9 files/s on four
  jobs, so a file costs ~0.5s and process start is well under a tenth of that.
  Nothing batching could have recovered was worth either of the above.

So the code is reverted and the measurement is kept, on `run_one`, where the
next person to have this idea will read it before having it. §B19.3 claimed
this was "the speedup that needs nothing"; it needed a measurement, and the
claim above it — that pointing `run.py` at a resident session would be the
largest speedup — had already been withdrawn for a different reason on the same
day. Two speedups proposed, two wrong, neither measured before being written
down.

**This is the fourth time.** §B15.12a recorded three optimisations reasoned from
the shape of the code — realm reuse, prelude bytecode caching, and a combined
settle hook — of which two were dangerous and one was useless. The lesson it
drew was that the rule against building what no page asked for applies to
performance too. It applies to *instruments* as well, and the tell is the same
every time: a sentence in this file that says a change will be fast, written
before anything was timed.


## B20. Chasing 80%, and what the concentration actually looks like, 2026-08-27

The question was how to get WPT coverage to 80%. The first thing the data said
is that "80% of what" has three answers and only one of them is honest, and the
second is that the gap is far more concentrated than anyone had assumed.

### B20.1 What 80% means, given §B19.2's tiers

| tier | before this work | to reach 80% |
| --- | --- | --- |
| core | 59,953 / 120,522 (49.7%) | +36,464 |
| encoding | 225,786 / 229,349 (98.4%) | already past |
| relevant | 985 / 19,020 (5.2%) | +14,231 |
| **scoped total** | **286,724 / 368,891 (77.7%)** | **+8,388** |

The scoped total is *already* 77.7%, and reaching 80% by that reading needs
almost nothing — which is precisely the §B13.3 trap the tiers file was built to
close: the encoding block is carrying it, and adding encoding subtests would be
gaming a number rather than improving an engine. **Core at 80% is the honest
target**, and it is the one everything below is measured against.

### B20.2 The gap is thirty files

Sorting core's unpassed subtests by file:

| | share of the core gap |
| --- | --- |
| top 30 files | **52.8%** |
| top 100 files | 65.5% |
| top 400 files | 79.9% |

Half the work is in thirty files. That is the §B12.2 shape again — a large
cluster with few causes — and it means the productive move is never "implement
more of the platform", it is "read what those thirty files say".

### B20.3 The reader did not lowercase what the writer did (+10,847)

Eleven of the top fifteen files shared one failure message, verbatim:

    assert_equals: getAttribute() expected (string) "" but got (object) null

DOM §4.9 lowercases the qualified name for an element in the HTML namespace, on
`getAttribute`, `hasAttribute`, `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` alike.
`set_attr` and `remove_attr` did; `get_attr` did not, and `hasAttribute`
inherited the bug through the same op.

It stayed invisible until the *harness* was read rather than the engine: WPT's
reflection harness passes the **IDL** name straight through to both calls
(`html/dom/reflection.js`: `domName = idlName`), so `setAttribute("accessKey")`
stored `accesskey` and `getAttribute("accessKey")` answered null. Every
camelCase reflected attribute failed on every element in all eleven
`reflection-*.html` files.

    html/dom  43,744 -> 54,591 of 60,514 scored  (72.3% -> 90.2%)

The fix is namespace-conditional, and that is not pedantry: the HTML parser
case-corrects SVG attributes, so an `<svg>` really does hold one named
`viewBox`, and a blanket lowercase would have traded one silent wrong answer
for another. `set_attr` lowercasing *unconditionally* was the same bug pointing
the other way — `svg.setAttribute("viewBox", …)` stored `viewbox` and rendered
nothing. All three share one normaliser now, because `guard_mutation` two
hundred lines below records what happened the last time a defect of this shape
was patched at each call site as it was found.

### B20.4 An instrument that was fine, and an analysis that was not

The first read of the data said 27% of the core gap sat behind
`TypeError: not a callable function`, which does not name the callee — and
therefore that the instrument had to be fixed before anything else, per §B8.

**That was wrong, and the correction is the useful part.** 87% of those
subtests already carry the name, in the `unsupported` side-channel the engine
has had since §B8.4. The analysis was reading `failures[].message` and never
joining the two channels. The engine names `Element.getHTML`,
`Element.setSelectionRange`, `document.createProcessingInstruction` and the
rest perfectly well; the script asking the question was the blind one.

Joined, and weighted by the unpassed subtests of the files that ask (calls
alone rank a hot loop above a blocker), the demand list is the ranked work
queue this section is built on. The genuine blind spot — named in neither
channel — is 292 files and 1,813 subtests.

### B20.5 `getHTML`, and a 6,908-subtest file that is not a 6,908-subtest win

`shadow-dom/declarative/gethtml.html` is the largest single file in core: 6,908
unpassed, zero passing. It was queued as the biggest available win. It is not,
and the breakdown says so exactly:

* **380 subtests** need only `getHTML()` to equal `innerHTML`. Built, and
  measured at exactly +380.
* **6,528 subtests** need a shadow root serialised as `<template
  shadowrootmode=…>` followed by the light children — and this engine has one
  tree. A shadow root here is a *view of its host*, the component's output and
  the light content are siblings in the same element, and nothing distinguishes
  them afterwards.

So the string a browser produces cannot be reconstructed, and emitting the
flattened content under a `<template shadowrootmode>` header would be markup
that parses, looks right, and describes a tree that never existed. It is
recorded through `unsupported()` instead.

The lesson is §B12.8's, inverted. That entry says a large failure cluster
usually has one cheap structural cause; this one has a single *expensive*
structural cause, and the file's size said nothing about which. **A subtest
count is a measure of how much a test file repeats itself, not of how much work
its failure represents.**

### B20.6 Interface objects: forty-seven names, and three bugs behind them

Forty-seven interface globals were missing — `Document`, `Response`,
`NodeList`, `HTMLCollection`, `Storage`, `CSSRule` and the rest — of which
several had full implementations behind them and only lacked the name.

**Why this is not the `missingApi` stub §B8.4 deleted.** That rule is about
*feature detection*: a name that exists and answers wrongly sends a page down a
branch it cannot recover from. A page writing `nodes instanceof NodeList` is
not detecting a feature, it is asking what it is holding, and the honest
answers are yes and no — never `ReferenceError`. So each interface object
carries a `Symbol.hasInstance` performing the real brand check against the
shape this engine builds, and `new NodeList()` still throws exactly as it does
in a browser.

Adding them surfaced three real bugs that had nothing to do with WPT:

* **`CharacterData` was `Text`.** A duplicate key in the globals literal, so
  the later binding won and `comment instanceof CharacterData` was **false**
  for a class the comment genuinely extends.
* **`option.value = x` was silently lost.** The setter took the editor path,
  which an option does not have, and stashed the value where the option's own
  getter never looks — taking `new Option(label, value)` with it.
* **`fetch` resolved an object literal.** It had the right fields, which reads
  identically until something asks what it is: `Response` was not a global, so
  `new Response(...)` was a ReferenceError and `res instanceof Response` could
  not be written at all.

And one that was ours all along: **interface objects were enumerable on the
global.** WebIDL §3.7 says otherwise, `Object.assign` creates enumerable data
properties, and `idlharness` checks it *first* for every interface — so the
cost was a subtest per interface across every `idlharness` file in the suite,
spent before anything about the interface was examined.

### B20.7 `new Document()`, and a score that depended on machine load

Exposing `Document` as non-constructible took `html/dom/idlharness.https.html`
from 269 passing to reporting **nothing at all**. `new Document()` is legal —
DOM §4.5 gives Document a constructor — and the test builds one in its setup,
so a brand that threw killed the file. That is §B8.4's own hazard in a new
costume: a name that exists and answers wrongly, added by the change that was
supposed to stop names being absent.

Made constructible, the file went from 373 subtests to **6,408, with 1,896
passing**. And then it became *unstable*: sometimes `ok`, sometimes
`no_report`, depending on nothing but how loaded the machine was.

The cause is `SCRIPT_PHASE_BUDGET`, a twenty-second wall-clock ceiling on a
page's script. The file legitimately needs about twenty seconds to parse the
IDL and build its tests, so it lands exactly on the line. The guard is right —
it is what stops a page whose promise chain never settles — and a conformance
harness is precisely where a runaway and a merely slow page are hard to tell
apart from outside.

**A run whose score depends on the other processes on the box is not a
measurement**, so `--script-seconds` lets an instrument say so, for the same
reason and with the same limits as §B19.5's `--allow-any-remote`: it announces
itself, it changes nothing for anyone who does not pass it, and the navigation
deadline still bounds the whole load. `wpt/run.py` passes 60.

    html/dom  54,591 -> 56,241 of 66,549 scored

### B20.8 `testdriver-vendor.js`: the second empty seam

`resources/testdriver-vendor.js` ships as a **zero-byte file**, for exactly the
reason `testharnessreport.js` does: it is where a vendor plugs its automation
in. Unfilled, `test_driver.click()` rejects with "not implemented by
testdriver-vendor.js" and every test built on it fails on a missing harness
rather than on anything about the engine — 633 files in core.

Filled in `wpt/serve.py`, beside the reporter, with no engine change at all.
`click` and `send_keys` are implemented by dispatching the events the action
would produce, which is the action rather than a simulation of it; `bless` (706
call sites) is built on `click` upstream, so one function unlocks both.
Everything needing authority this engine does not have — permissions, virtual
sensors, virtual authenticators, a second browsing context — keeps testdriver's
own rejection, because a shim that resolved those would turn "the harness
cannot do this" into "the engine got the wrong answer".

`action_sequence` is refused for a narrower reason: it is a pointer and key
state machine with its own tick semantics, and approximating it would make a
class of failures untraceable.

### B20.9 A comparison that was measured against the wrong thing

Partway through, `shadow-dom` appeared to have regressed by 192 subtests and
three `reference-target` files by 587. Bisecting found the same directory
scoring 41 of 473 both with and without every change in this section: the
comparison was against `results-2026-08-10`, and the difference was a month of
drift in the engine and in the WPT checkout.

The rule this earns is small and was being broken all day: **a before/after
comparison needs a before taken from the current commit.** A stale artifact is
a different engine and a different corpus, and it will attribute someone else's
work — in either direction — to yours. Every number in this section is against
a freshly measured baseline for that reason.

### B20.10 The second pass: types, names, and two features that were declared and never acted on

Four more rounds, each found the same way — read what the failures say, fix the
cause rather than the file.

**The reflection *type system*, which is per-element and therefore never
small.** Four bugs, all of them repeating on every element in every
`reflection-*.html`:

* **`-0`.** `Number("-0")` is negative zero, an IDL long is an integer, and
  testharness compares with `Object.is` semantics — so `tabindex="-0"` failed
  `assert_equals(0)` everywhere. `tabIndex` has its own parser and needed the
  same fix twice.
* **Out of the 32-bit range is "not a valid integer"**, not a large number.
* **`[LegacyNullToEmptyString]`** on the legacy colour attributes: `bgColor =
  null` writes `""`. Marked per attribute, because everywhere else `null`
  really does stringify.
* **`action`/`formAction` answer with the document's address** when unset. A
  form whose action reads `""` submits somewhere different from one that reads
  the page's URL.

Plus nine element interfaces the table never had — meter, progress, iframe,
del, q, th, thead, tfoot, colgroup — where `ins` was present and `del` was not,
`td` was present and `th` was not. A missing entry is not one attribute
missing; it is every attribute of that element failing at once.

    html/dom  56,241 -> 57,080

**Custom element names, and two wrong turns worth more than the fix.**
`define` enforced one rule of eight. Implementing the rest took
`valid-custom-element-names.html` from 222 of 1,975 to **1,975 of 1,975** — but
only after two mistakes:

1. The first implementation used `PotentialCustomElementNameChar`, which is
   the **superseded** production. whatwg/html#7991 replaced it with "a valid
   element local name", which *excludes* rather than includes. So the old rule
   rejected names that are now legal, and failed the file in the opposite
   direction from the one it was written to fix. **Implementing from memory of
   a spec is implementing a spec that may have moved.**
2. `whenDefined` did not validate. Once `define` threw correctly, the test
   reached `await promise_rejects_dom(t, 'SyntaxError', whenDefined(bad))` and
   hung there — taking all 5,900 subtests with it, and turning a +1,753 into a
   -222 until it was found. **A promise that never settles is the worst of the
   three answers**: a caller cannot tell it from a component that has not
   loaded, so it waits out its own timeout instead of handling an error it
   could have handled at once.

**Popovers and `<dialog>`: declared and never acted on.**
`html/semantics/popovers` was 3,846 unpassed against 20 passing, and the reason
was not that the feature is large: the `popover` attribute *reflected*, and
nothing anywhere did anything with it. `<dialog>` was the same shape — `open`
reflected, and `show`, `showModal` and `close` were all absent, so a dialog
could be described and never opened.

Both are now real as far as the DOM goes: the state machine, the exceptions,
the `beforetoggle`/`toggle` pair with its cancel-on-open-only asymmetry, the
`popovertarget` invoker, `returnValue`. What is deliberately not real is the
**top layer** — this engine has no separate paint layer, so an open popover
renders where it sits and a modal dialog does not block the page behind it.
That is a rendering property; the API contract a page scripts against is not,
and the two halves are worth separating rather than refusing the feature whole.

Three things fell out of building it that the tests would not have said
directly:

* `<div popover>` has the value `""`, which maps to the **auto** state. Without
  the alias it fell through to `invalid` and every bare popover reported
  `"manual"` — the one state that does *not* close its peers, so they stacked.
* `popover` is **nullable**: an element without the attribute reports `null`,
  which is how a page asks "is this a popover at all". Reporting `""` made
  every element look like one.
* An invoker runs **after** the click and only if it was not cancelled, so the
  click event has to be held and asked. Dispatching and discarding it made
  `preventDefault()` in a handler do nothing.

**URL and body plumbing.** `new URLSearchParams(otherParams)` walked the
object's own keys, copied the internal `_pairs` field, and serialised as
`_pairs=a%2Cb` — a params object emitting its own implementation. It takes any
iterable of pairs now, plus `sort()`, `size`, proper form-urlencoded output
(`+` for space and the escapes `encodeURIComponent` leaves alone), the
`URL.parse`/`canParse` statics, and `formData`/`arrayBuffer`/`blob` on both
`Request` and `Response`.

    url  68 -> 148 of 499

### B20.11 Four more, and the shape of what is left

**Popovers and `<dialog>`, measured.** `html/semantics` 2,839 -> **4,642**, and
`html/dom` +418 alongside. The feature was not large; it was unwired.

**`DOMTokenList`, four gaps in one type.** `replace()` was absent — 262 corpus
asks — indexed access answered `undefined`, and neither validation existed, so
`classList.add("")` wrote a trailing space and `classList.add("a b")` wrote a
token that read back as *two*. That last one is the bad kind of bug: a class a
page added could not be removed again.

**`createElementNS` accepted anything**, which is why
`dom/nodes/Document-createElementNS.html` scored **1 of 596** — the file is
almost entirely a sweep of names that must be rejected. It validates the XML
`Name` production now and keeps `InvalidCharacterError` ("that is not a name")
apart from `NamespaceError` ("that name and that namespace may not go
together"), because pages catch them separately.

    dom  2,022 -> 2,629

### B20.12 Forms, which was the one large block that was just work

§B20.11 named `html/semantics/forms` as the only big remaining cluster that
needed no design reversal. It was **723 passing of 4,870**, and the reason was
not subtlety: the constraint validation API did not exist at all. Nine files
scored 1 of 920 between them, every one failing on *"the validity attribute
doesn't exist"* before reaching what it meant to check.

**Built, in the order the failures ranked them:**

* **Constraint validation.** `validity`, `willValidate`, `validationMessage`,
  `checkValidity`, `reportValidity`, `setCustomValidity`, and the form-level
  pair. The barred-from-validation clause is the part worth reading: a disabled
  control that reported itself invalid would block a form the user cannot even
  reach, so barred elements are always valid *including* when a custom error
  was set. `reportValidity` is identical to `checkValidity` here and says so —
  the difference is that a browser shows the message, and there is no UI to
  show it in.
* **Text-field selection.** `selectionStart`/`End`/`Direction`,
  `setSelectionRange`, `setRangeText` with all four select modes, `select`. The
  selection lives on this side rather than in the layout engine, because it has
  to answer for a detached control too. `<input type=number>` reports `null`
  rather than 0, which is the distinction a page tests before using it.
* **Numeric inputs.** `valueAsNumber`, `valueAsDate`, `stepUp`, `stepDown`,
  `showPicker`, all keyed off one table so a type is steppable in one place
  rather than four that can disagree. NaN rather than `undefined` for a type
  with no numeric form: `undefined` says "this engine lacks the property", NaN
  says "this control holds no number".
* **`<input type=color>` sanitisation**, `files` returning `null` off a
  non-file input, and `form.autocomplete` defaulting to `on`.

**Three bugs that had nothing to do with forms fell out of it.**

* **An empty `<input>` read as `" "`.** blitz seeds a laid-out input's editor
  with a single space, and the value getter applied its whitespace-is-unseeded
  rule to `<textarea>` only. So `if (!input.value)` was **false** for an empty
  field: every page and every agent testing a form for emptiness got the wrong
  answer, and `required` could never fire. Found only because constraint
  validation asked the question a different way.
* **`cloneNode` copied `class` and `style` and nothing else.** A clone lost its
  `id`, its `href`, its `data-*` and every hook a page had put on it — so a
  cloned `<template>` came out stripped. The form-control cloning steps (the
  value and the dirty value flag) were missing with them.
* **`click()` on a disabled control dispatched a click.** A page that disables
  a control to stop it being used still saw it used, with the form in whatever
  state the disabling was meant to protect.

    html/semantics/forms  723 -> 2,012 of 4,655
    html/dom              57,498 -> 58,073
    dom                   2,629 -> 2,651
    gate                  288,183 -> 288,780, no regression

What is left in forms is genuinely different in kind: form *submission*
(`multipart/form-data`, `text/plain`, the submission algorithm), `:focus` in
the selector engine, and `color()` CSS parsing. Submission is the largest and
is the one worth taking next — it is the half of a form this engine can
observe better than anything else, because it *is* the HTTP client.

### B20.13 Submission, and the boundary it ran into

The rest of forms was submission, and §B20.12 said it was worth taking because
this engine *is* the HTTP client. Built:

* **Form ownership, which is not containment.** `formOwnerOf` honours the
  `form` content attribute, and the bug it fixes is a wrong answer rather than
  a missing one: `form=""` names no id and therefore has no owner, but the old
  code read the attribute for truthiness and fell through to the ancestor
  search — reporting the surrounding form, when taking a control *out* of the
  form it sits in is the entire purpose of the attribute. `form.elements` now
  asks the same question, so a control with `form="thisId"` is submitted from
  anywhere on the page.
* **The entry list**, properly: the submitter is an entry (skipping every
  button meant a server could not tell which one was pressed), `_charset_` is
  filled in by the engine, a `<datalist>` descendant is a suggestion and never
  an entry, and disabled and unnamed controls are excluded.
* **The `formdata` event**, which fires with the list under construction rather
  than a copy — that is the documented replacement for the hidden inputs a page
  used to inject.
* **`requestSubmit` and `submit`**, which differ in the two ways that matter:
  the first validates and fires a cancelable `submit`, the second does neither.
  Implementing them as one function is the obvious shortcut and would make
  `form.submit()` called from inside a `submit` handler recurse.

Neither *navigates*, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished: this engine
drives navigation through its own verbs so that an agent and a receipt both see
it, and a form submitting itself out from under that would be a request nothing
decided on.

*Revised by §B24.3: the reasoning holds and the boundary was in the wrong
place. Neither navigates from inside the realm, but both now produce a real
request, which the session sends at the verb boundary and reports.*

**A bug found by this that had nothing to do with forms.** `form.elements` came
back empty, because it compared `formOwnerOf(el) === this` — and `wrap()` hands
back the `observed` proxy while a getter runs with the raw target as `this`, by
design (`observed` passes the target as receiver to avoid paying a trap per
field read). So a proxy and its target are two objects for the same node, and
identity comparison silently answers "different" for **every element**. Any
code anywhere comparing two wrappers with `===` has the same defect; there is
now a `sameNode` helper saying so.

    html/semantics/forms  2,012 -> 2,051 of 4,655

**And the boundary.** The remaining mass in `form-submission-0` is three
enctype files at 62 subtests each plus the double-submit pair, and every one of
them submits into an `<iframe>` and waits for its load. That is §B6's refusal,
reached from a third direction — after declarative shadow DOM (§B20.5) and
`html/browsers/origin`. The submission *algorithm* is now implemented and
observable; what is not reachable is being navigated by it.

### B20.14 Where core stands, and what 80% would actually take

**58.5%** — 76,760 of 131,201 — from 49.7%, measured across all nineteen core
directories, 9,492 files, on a freshly built binary. The session moved roughly
15,000 subtests.

80% is +28,200 from here, and the honest reading of the remaining mass is that
**the cheap shared causes are spent.** Four blocks hold most of it, and two of
them are decisions rather than work:

| block | unpassed | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gethtml.html` + declarative shadow DOM | ~7,100 | needs a real shadow tree. §B6 chose flattening, and §B20.5 is where that choice becomes a number. |
| `html/dom/idlharness` | 4,496 | correct IDL shapes — prototypes, descriptors, inheritance — on every interface. Grind, not design. |
| `html/semantics/forms` | 4,147 | validity API, text-field selection, submission. **The one large block that is just work.** |
| `fetch` | 4,539 | 260 of 467 files time out on abort semantics, which a synchronous fetch cannot provide. **Wrong — see §B23.3.** Script `fetch` is already concurrent, and 1,392 of those subtests need a wptserve `.py` handler rather than abort. |

So the path to 80% runs through two product decisions — whether a shadow root
is a real tree, and whether `fetch` stays synchronous underneath — plus the
forms block and a long tail. None of that is discovered by pointing the harness
at more directories; it was discovered by reading what the failures said, which
is the only method in this section that has worked at all.

**A caution on the number itself.** 58.5% is the core tier as `tiers.list`
defines it, and §B12.6's three ways to move a score all applied today:
implementing more (most of it), measuring more (`idlharness` becoming
reportable at all, which added 6,000 subtests to the denominator as well as
1,896 to the numerator), and counting more honestly. The first is the only one
that is engineering, and the tier table is what keeps the three visible.

### B20.15 The three boundaries, decided, 2026-08-28

§B20.14 ended on three blocks that were "blocked on a product decision, not on
effort", holding roughly 19,000 of the 23,600 subtests between the engine and
80%. The decision was put, and made, and this entry is the record — argued on
the product's terms, because §B20.5 already established that a WPT subtest
count measures how much a test file repeats itself, not how much a gap costs.
The question for each was: *what does an agent driving a real page lose?*

**1. No second browsing context — kept, with one carve-out.** The real-web
cost is concentrated and real: payment iframes, OAuth popups, embedded
CAPTCHAs are exactly the tasks agents get asked to do. But supporting it
honestly is the most expensive item in the engine: two origins in one realm is
precisely the hazard `cookies.rs` documents — the box protects the host from
the page and says nothing about two origins sharing an address space, which is
why `retain_origin` drops the jar on every origin change. A cross-origin
iframe reintroduces the problem that rule exists to bound, and doing it right
is what Chromium calls site isolation. For an engine whose thesis is
auditability, "two origins, one process, one realm" is a worse position than
"no iframes".

The carve-out: **`window.open` is not an iframe problem — it maps onto h5i's
own session model.** A popup is a second page, and h5i already has named
sessions. So `window.open` should become a *named refusal carrying a recovery*
("this page wants a second page; open one with `--session`"), per §B15.6's
rule that a denial an agent cannot branch on is a denial it cannot recover
from. Queued.

*Revisit trigger:* the corpus's `unsupported` counts — real agent tasks dying
on iframes — never WPT. And the first step if it fires is same-origin
`srcdoc` iframes only, which raise no isolation question, not the full
feature.

**2. Flattened shadow root — kept, and this is the one defended hardest.**
The 7,140-subtest figure is the most misleading number on the table: 6,528 of
it is one file serialising `<template shadowrootmode>` strings. The
flattening is not a shortcut but an *aligned* choice — it is what the
accessibility tree does, and the accessibility tree is what the snapshot is
modeled on. An agent wants the component's rendered output, readable, in the
page; a real shadow tree would break the one-tree invariant that snapshot,
paint and events all rely on, to buy encapsulation — a property that serves
page authors and actively hurts page readers.

The one real cost is **style scoping**: a component-heavy page can misrender
because styles leak across the boundary. *Revisit trigger:* corpus pages
visibly misrendering from leakage — and the fix would be scoping in the
cascade, not a second tree. Never `gethtml.html`.

**3. Synchronous fetch — not a boundary at all, reclassified.** The other two
are derived from the product's claims; this one is an implementation ceiling
wearing a boundary's clothes. Fail-closed requires *decide and record before
the bytes move* — nothing in that forces the transport to block. The
`Cargo.toml` comment defends synchrony with "receipt order is request order",
but decision order can be preserved without serialised transport. The
real-web costs are already on the record from §B16: serial subresource
fetching is one of the three load-path costs the Lightpanda study named, and
an abort that cancels nothing is why 260 of 467 fetch files time out.

The decision is **do not build it for WPT**: run the repaired
`corpus/compare.py` first (§B19.5's own unfinished business) and see whether
serial fetch is where real-page latency actually goes. If it is, concurrent
brokered fetch with real abort is ordinary engineering that *strengthens* the
receipts story. If it is not, leave it. §B15.12a, applied before the mistake
this time instead of after.

#### The tiers.list edits, and the number moving for the third reason

With 1 and 2 kept on purpose, 80% of the old core tier is not this engine's
number — and the honest response is the one `tiers.list` was built for:
declare the refusals as scope, with the reasons on the line, and let core
measure what the engine actually claims to be. Three entries moved to
`exclude`:

| entry | reason on the line |
| --- | --- |
| `html/browsers/origin` | needs several live browsing contexts talking to each other |
| `fetch/metadata` | observed through `window.open` + wptserve `.py` handlers; **the feature is still wanted** — this engine *is* the client and should send `Sec-Fetch-*` for real sites. Excluding the tests does not excuse the feature. |
| `shadow-dom/declarative/gethtml.html` | one file, by exact path, so the rest of shadow-dom stays measured |

And two that look like candidates and are **not** excluded, because excluding
either would be exclusion by outcome wearing a capability's name: the
form-submission enctype files (their *subject* is entry-list serialisation,
which this engine claims — only the harness observes it through an iframe),
and the fetch abort timeouts (an implementation ceiling, per decision 3, not a
declared boundary). Both stay in core as honest losses.

The effect, stated the way §B12.6 requires because this is its third way of
moving a number — counting differently, not engineering:

    core, old scope   81,120 / 130,958 = 61.9%
    core, new scope   80,738 / 121,987 = 66.2%
    moved out         8,971 scored, of which only 382 passed
    80% now needs     +16,851

Nothing got better; the denominator now says what the engine is. The moved-out
block was 4% passing, which is exactly what a capability hole looks like from
the outside — and also exactly why the exclusion had to be argued from the
product rather than read off the score, since excluding your worst directory
is what a gamed number looks like too. The difference between those two is
that the reasons are on the line in `tiers.list`, where moving a line and
re-running is the audit.

## B21. Reopening two boundaries on task evidence, 2026-08-28

§B20.15's revisit triggers fired the day they were written: task evidence — the
operator's own agent runs, not WPT — showed real work blocked on frames and on
fetch's abort behaviour. This section records what was reopened, how far, and
where the line now is.

### B21.1 Abort, made observable

The claim in §B20.15 that "fetch is synchronous underneath" turned out to be
half stale: script fetches have run on a thread pool (six slots) since the
ticket queue landed. What was real is that **abort only took effect when the
network answered** — the drain checked `signal.aborted` on arrival, so an
`abort()` against a slow server rejected whenever the server got around to it,
and against one that never answers, never. 260 of 467 fetch files timed out on
exactly this shape.

The fix distinguishes the two halves of abort, and implements the one a page
can observe: **the promise rejects the moment the page says stop**, while the
wire request runs to completion on its thread and its receipt stands — because
the request *was* made, and a receipt that vanished when the page changed its
mind would be a log of intentions rather than of traffic.

Also corrected while there: the rejection reason is now a `DOMException` named
`AbortError` — every consumer that distinguishes an abort from a failure does
it by `e.name === "AbortError"`, and rejecting with a plain `Error` sent all of
them down the failure branch. `AbortSignal.timeout()` (on the virtual clock,
so a fetch-versus-timeout race settles deterministically here) and
`AbortSignal.any()` came with it.

**Measured.** `fetch/api/abort` goes from hanging its files to 32 of 96
scored with three files still timing out — and the remainder is the static
server's, not the engine's: the mid-download abort tests stream from
wptserve's `infinite-slow-response.py`, a handler `wpt/serve.py` cannot run
(§B19.3's wptserve backend is the road to those). Two shape fixes came out of
reading the failures: every `Request` now mints a `signal` when the caller
brings none — `request.signal` being null sent every page that wires abort
through the request object down the wrong branch — and the whole gate moved
+23 alongside.

### B21.2 `window.open`: the named refusal, built

The §B20.15 carve-out, as specified: `window.open` returns `null` — the answer
every page already handles, because it is what a popup blocker produces — and
says why on the console and in the unsupported list, naming the recovery: open
the URL in another session and drive both. Deliberately not a same-realm fake
window, which would hand the opened page's globals to the opener — the
two-origins-one-realm hazard wearing a friendlier face.

### B21.3 Frames as content: the narrow reopening

The decision §B20.15 kept — no second browsing context — stands. What task
evidence forced is narrower and turns out to be buildable without touching the
boundary: **a frame's document is fetched and its content flattened into the
page**, exactly as a shadow root is flattened, readable in the snapshot and
actionable by the verbs. The payment form inside the iframe mints refs like
any other form.

What crosses, and what does not:

* Every frame fetch goes through the broker under its own initiator —
  **`frame` in the request log** — so an auditor asking "did this page pull in
  another document" gets the answer by name. The allowlist applies unchanged;
  a refused frame is a *note the agent reads*, never an empty box.
* **Its scripts never run** (stripped after the graft, and `javascript:`
  frames are refused by name — script by another road). Running a second
  document's script in this realm is the hazard the boundary exists for.
* **Its styles do not apply** (also stripped): the host cascade applying a
  foreign document's rules to the whole page would be a worse lie than
  unstyled frame content.
* **`contentDocument` still answers null.** A flattened frame is content, not
  a browsing context.
* Bounded at eight frames per page, nested included, and the bound is *said*
  (§B16.10) — ad cascades nest without limit and every fetch spends the
  page's own budget.

Three findings from building it, each worth more than the feature:

* **Fragment parsing inside `<iframe>` is raw text.** The first graft set the
  frame's own innerHTML and produced one text node of escaped markup — the
  HTML parser's rule, not a bug. The graft goes into a `<div>` container.
* **Blitz styles nothing it will not render**, so the snapshot's
  hidden-content defence — "no styles means hidden" — silently dropped every
  grafted subtree. Inside a frame that inference is wrong: no styles means
  *outside the styled tree*. The walk now carries an `in_frame` flag, and the
  hiding vectors a page actually controls there — the `hidden` attribute,
  inline `display:none`, `aria-hidden` — keep their teeth, verified by test.
  What is lost is stylesheet-based hiding, whose stylesheet was stripped at
  the graft and whose absence the frame note declares.
* **The document-origin loopback rule fired on the first test draft**, refusing
  a web page's frame from reaching the dev server. §B3.1 doing its job on a
  road that did not exist when it was written; the test suite now pins it.

### B21.4 What this did not reopen

`tiers.list` is unchanged. `html/browsers/origin` still needs several live
browsing contexts *scripting each other*; `fetch/metadata` still needs
`window.open` that opens; the enctype files still observe submission through a
frame's *load*, which a flattened frame does not perform. Frames-as-content
moves what an agent can read and drive, which is what the task evidence asked
for — it does not move what the excluded tests measure.


## B22. One bool in a vendored stylo, and the mechanical clusters, 2026-08-28

The 80% campaign's second front, on the branch after #569 merged. Gate:
288,807 -> 290,137. Two kinds of work, and the first is one line long.

### B22.1 `:has()`: parse was the only gate

§B20's probe found selector invalidation working for descendants, siblings and
`:not` — and `:has()` never matching. The cause sits in stylo 0.19's Servo
selector parser: `parse_has()` is **hardcoded to `false`**. Not a preference,
a constant; nothing outside a patch can turn it on.

So `vendor/stylo` now exists: the crates.io tarball, byte-identical except for
that one bool, pinned by `[patch.crates-io]` so Blitz's own stylo — the copy
that parses stylesheets — is the same copy. The pattern is Obscura's
taffy/cosmic-text one, the crate is 5.6MB, and `vendor/stylo/README-h5i.md`
carries the exit condition: diff against the tarball on every bump, and drop
the copy when upstream flips the bet.

The bet was that the matching machinery underneath — the code Gecko ships —
needed nothing. It held on every axis at once: `querySelector(':has()')`
matches, the relative form (`:has(> .flag)`) matches, **stylesheet rules
match, and invalidation works** — a class added by script restyles the
`:has()` container. The corpus's `selector :has()` entry retires, and the
refusal branch in `checkSelector` goes with it: a parse failure there is once
again what it says, a selector no browser would accept.

    css/selectors  2,115 -> 2,620

> **Reversed, 2026-08-28, by owner decision.** The technical bet held; the
> maintenance bet did not survive review. A 5.6MB in-tree copy of a
> rendering-engine crate is a fork this project would have to carry across
> every stylo bump, and the owner's judgment is that no WPT arithmetic pays
> for that. `vendor/stylo` is deleted and the `[patch.crates-io]` entry with
> it.
>
> **What replaces it:** the *query* half of `:has()` is evaluated in the
> prelude (`withHasMarkers`), no fork required: each `:has(ARG)` group is
> computed into a transient marker class — the engine's own matcher does the
> matching, a leading `>`/`+`/`~` anchors through a scope marker, the
> descendant form takes an ancestors-of-matches fast path — the selector is
> rewritten to the marker, the ordinary query runs, and the markers are
> removed before the call returns, invisible to observers and reactions. So
> `querySelector`/`querySelectorAll`/`matches`/`closest` keep `:has()`.
> **Stylesheet rules** using `:has()` are the half that stays lost: they go
> through Stylo's parser inside Blitz and are dropped there, which takes the
> `has-in-*` styling/invalidation suites with them (§B22.11's root-restyle
> hint stays — sibling combinators still need it). The clean exit for that
> half is the first Blitz release that depends on stylo >= 0.20 (0.20.0 is
> published; check `parse_has` there when Blitz moves).

### B22.2 The mechanical clusters: tables transcribed, not invented

Everything else in the round is a spec table this engine had approximated:

* **The ARIA enumerated table, per attribute.** The first cut (§B20) declared
  all twenty as `{missing: null, invalid: ""}`, and the uniformity was the
  bug: `ariaHidden`'s missing value *means* not-hidden ("false"),
  `ariaChecked`'s means there is no checkedness to report (null), and
  `ariaCurrent` preserves any claim of currency as "true". Transcribed from
  the spec, with `nullable` as its own flag because several attributes remove
  on null while reading a missing attribute as "false".
  `html/dom`: 58,079 -> 59,078.
* **`createEvent`, both directions of the table.** An alias constructs the
  *mapped* interface — `createEvent("MouseEvents")` has MouseEvent.prototype —
  and a name off the table throws NotSupportedError even when the interface
  exists, because createEvent is a legacy door the spec stopped widening.
  Returning a generic Event for every name got both directions wrong at once.
  With it came the interfaces the table names (BeforeUnloadEvent, DragEvent,
  TextEvent, the Device* pair) and the `init*Event` methods.
* **Doctypes and processing instructions construct.** Three strings and a
  nodeType each; refusing them was never a capability question. Both validate
  their names, and a PI's data may not contain `?>` — which would end the
  instruction early on serialisation and turn the rest into markup.
* **The namespace trio** (`lookupNamespaceURI`, `lookupPrefix`,
  `isDefaultNamespace`), with the answers an HTML document gives — the spec's
  walk collapses to a table over the only tree shape this engine holds, which
  is not a stub, it is what the full algorithm computes here.
* **`createElementNS` carries its namespace on the wrapper.** The one tree is
  an HTML tree, so `namespaceURI`, `prefix` and the original-case local name
  live on the cached JS wrapper: an SVG `circle` reports `circle` (not
  `CIRCLE`), its namespace, and its prefix, while layout keeps treating the
  node as the HTML-parsed name underneath.

    dom  2,672 -> 3,003

### B22.3 The interface objects idlharness could never see

The idlharness deep-dive found one structural cause wearing four failure
shapes: **the per-tag classes were real and the globals were aliases.** The
reflection table has minted a genuine `HTMLOptionElement` (prototype carrying
`label`, `value`, the lot) since §B15's per-tag work — and §B20's
interface-globals literal then *overwrote* every such name with the bare
`Element` alias, because `Object.assign` last-write-wins and the literal came
later. So `window.HTMLOptionElement.prototype` was empty while every actual
option used an internal class no test could reach, and `instanceof
HTMLOptionElement` was true for a `<div>`.

The fix is one expression — the alias fills only names the per-tag block left
— plus the WebIDL plumbing idlharness checks per attribute: **brand guards**
(reading `HTMLElement.prototype.title` with the prototype as `this` throws
TypeError instead of dereferencing an `_id` that is not there), **enumerable
accessors** (WebIDL interface members are enumerable; class syntax defaults
the other way), and **class strings** (`Object.prototype.toString` on a `<p>`
says `[object HTMLParagraphElement]`).

And one regression caught by the per-directory measure before it could land:
deduping by interface *name* — §B20 had added `th`, `colgroup`, `thead`,
`tfoot`, `del` and `q` as their own table entries, duplicating names the
`SHARED` map already handled, so the loop minted **two distinct classes with
one name**: elements constructed with one while the global was the other, and
`col instanceof HTMLTableColElement` was false for a col whose
`constructor.name` said otherwise. One class per name now, holding the union.

    idlharness       2,493 -> 2,842 passing
    html/dom         59,078 -> 59,435
    html/semantics   5,999 -> 6,383
    gate             290,137 -> 290,494, no regression

### B22.4 Open popovers, and the two lies visibility told

The popover cluster (~1,700 subtests) came down to two false answers and a
missing API family, and the diagnosis mattered more than the patch.

**The engine could not show a popover — at all.** Blitz's UA sheet carries the
standard's hiding rule, `[popover]:not(:popover-open):not(dialog[open])
{ display: none; }`, and hard-codes the `:popover-open` pseudo-class to never
match — so the rule applies to every popover forever, at specificity (0,3,1),
which also outweighs any casual same-origin override. That produced a long
false trail: marker-class UA rules that "didn't invalidate" were actually
being outranked (there is no Stylo invalidation bug; author-origin equivalents
worked because origin, not weight, decided). The fix is one UA rule keyed on
the prelude's marker class, stacked to (0,5,0) so it outweighs the hider:
`[popover][popover][popover][popover].__h5i_popover_open__ { display: block; }`.

**`getClientRects()` returned a rect for everything**, including `display:
none` elements — and `offsetWidth || getClientRects().length` is WPT's (and
half the web's) visibility idiom, so every hidden element read as visible.
Empty list now when the element generates no boxes.

With visibility honest, the rest was contract work: repeated
`showPopover()`/`hidePopover()` are silent no-ops (the spec's validity check
never throws for a visibility mismatch — the throwing version failed ~1,175
subtests across two files), `popoverTargetElement` became a real reflected
element reference (attribute stamped to `""` on assignment, `null` while the
target is disconnected), input invokers gated to the four button types, and
the Invoker Commands API landed beside it: `CommandEvent`,
`command`/`commandForElement` on buttons, the six built-in verbs acting on
dialogs and popovers, `dialog.requestClose()` with its cancelable `cancel`,
`form.reset()`, and submit/reset buttons that actually submit and reset their
form on click. `oncommand`/`ontoggle`/`onbeforetoggle`/`oncancel`/`onclose`
joined the handler set.

    html/semantics   6,383 -> 8,024  (popovers dir: 1,732 -> ~2,600 of it)
    dom              2,672 -> 3,003  (the getClientRects half)
    core tier        69.2% at the start of this entry, recompute pending

### B22.5–B22.13 The grind from 69% to the high seventies

Nine commits, each its own story in the log; what belongs here is the
pattern. Almost every point of coverage in this stretch came from one of
three shapes of gap, and knowing the shapes made the next gap cheaper to
find than the last:

**Contracts the engine had half of.** The popover state machine existed but
threw where the spec stays silent (§B22.4's follow-through); `<input>` had
`value` but not the four value modes or a single sanitizer; options had a
`selected` attribute but no selectedness *state*; scripts ran when the
parser saw them but never when a page inserted one — the single largest
real-web gap found in this campaign, since every script-loader works by
injecting tags. In each case the feature "was there" and pages still broke,
because the contract is the edges, not the middle.

**Answers coming from the wrong authority.** `getClientRects()` said
"visible" for hidden elements; `CSS.supports` and `'prop' in el.style`
disagreed until both asked Stylo's content-gated parser; enumerated
reflections folded Unicode case when the spec folds ASCII (WPT plants
U+212A to catch exactly this); `innerText` ignored computed `white-space`
until the walker read it. The recurring fix: find the one place that
already knows, and ask it.

**WebIDL shape, mechanically.** Interface constants, accessor names
(`get title`), enumerability, brand guards (`this instanceof Interface`),
collections as real classes over real arrays (prototype swapped, so array
ergonomics survive), event-init fields as prototype accessors, ValidityState
and ElementInternals as live interfaces. Individually tiny; ~2,000 subtests
in aggregate, because idlharness checks every member of every interface.

One engine-level find deserves its own line: Blitz hints the element and
one parent on attribute flips, which is exactly not far enough for `:has()`
and sibling combinators — a root-subtree re-match hint on every attribute
mutation (folded into one resolve per settle by `styles_stale`) lit up the
whole has-invalidation suite. And one crash: `Element.prototype.innerHTML`'s
setter borrowed onto a doctype wrapper panicked the engine from page script;
it now throws the TypeError it owed.

    core tier   66.2% at branch start -> 75.7% (88,199 / 116,471, full fresh
                sweep 2026-08-28) measured with the vendored :has() stylo;
                ~74.5% after its removal (see the §B22.1 reversal note) —
                the 80% mark is the next branch's target
    html/semantics 5,999 -> 9,623 · html/dom 59,435 -> 62,092
    css/selectors 2,115 -> 3,090, then the :has() share given back
    css-conditional 881 -> 1,601 · custom-elements 2,217 -> 2,414
    domparsing 172 -> 384 · dom 2,672 -> 3,278

The pools where the next ~5,000 live, measured and ranked: the idlharness
file itself (2,628 still failing — the missing-global family is mostly
capability interfaces this engine deliberately refuses to fake),
html/semantics' script/img/media/dialog clusters (~6,400), dom's XML-document
family (`createDocument` and the case rules, ~600), cssom/cssom-view
serialization and scroll geometry, and the fetch/api JS surface
(Headers/Request/Response conformance, ~400 reachable without wptserve).

## B23. The instrument was measuring a coin toss, 2026-08-30

Core **74.8% -> 76.4%** (91,480 -> ~93,500 of 122,299) in eleven commits. The
coverage is the smaller half of what this branch produced; three of the things
it found are corrections to what this document says.

### B23.1 A file worth 5% of the denominator, decided by 1.2 seconds

`html/dom/idlharness.https.html` took **28.8s** under `sweep.sh`'s 30s deadline
on one run and timed out on the next. That file is **6,408 subtests — 5.2% of
the core denominator** — and it passes about 60%, so *losing* it moved the
headline from 74.8% **up** to 75.6% while the engine had strictly improved.

The direction is the dangerous part: dropping the worst-scoring large file looks
like progress. Two consecutive sweeps of the same tree differed by 6,387 in the
denominator and nothing had changed.

It is not one file. **7,325 subtests — 6.3% of the denominator — sit in files
that finish within ten seconds of the old deadline**, the two CSSOM `idlharness`
files at 20.5s and 20.2s next in line. `sweep.sh` and `gate.sh` now default to
90s, which costs about three minutes on a twenty-five minute sweep because only
**14 files** in an entire sweep reach `engine_timeout` — the 271 `fetch` files
that time out are `harness_timeout` and report well inside the deadline.

§B12.5 says a pass count is only a floor if the corpus is fixed. This is its
sibling and belongs beside it: **it is only a floor if the deadline is generous
enough that the largest file's outcome is not a coin toss.**

`run.py` also kept only **five** failing subtests per file, which is the right
default for reading counts and the wrong one for a file with 2,539 failures —
§B12.2's lesson about reading failure text is exactly the one that cap defeats
on the largest files. Now `WPT_MAX_FAILURES`, default unchanged.

### B23.2 "Unpassed in files that mention X" is an upper bound, not an estimate

Four times on one branch a count promised far more than it paid:

| what promised | what paid |
| --- | --- |
| `action_sequence`: 383 subtests rejecting on it | 126 (33%) |
| demand list ranked by calls: 7,938 on the top entry | one test file's helper |
| demand list ranked by files: 429 and 259 for two APIs | 32 |
| `fetch/` + `xhr/` + `cors/`: "3,171 blocked on async fetch" | see §B23.3 |

The rule, stated so the next queue is built differently: **only a failure
*message* directly attributable to X predicts the gain.** `serialize-values`,
where 164 failures literally said the serialised value was wrong, delivered 158.
`:heading`, where 277 said "is not a valid selector", delivered 205. Every count
of the form "unpassed in files that touch X" carried a large and unpredictable
discount, because unblocking a gate reveals the next problem rather than solving
it.

The demand list has a second trap worth naming: it is unweighted, so one test
file's helper reading a property off an element put `Element.endsWith` at the
top with 7,938 calls. Ranking it by *files* instead fixes that and does not fix
the discount — `Element.disabled` led that ranking with 153 files, and
`button.disabled` works.

### B23.3 §B20.14's fetch row is wrong, and the correction matters more than the row

§B20.14 records:

> | `fetch` | 4,539 | 260 of 467 files time out on abort semantics, which a
> synchronous fetch cannot provide. |

**Script `fetch()` is already concurrent.** `FetchSlot::InFlight(Receiver)` —
six requests on their own threads, drained on the settle loop. What is still
synchronous is `BrokerNet::fetch`, Blitz's *subresource* loading, which §B20.15
names correctly ("serial subresource fetching"); the generalisation to script
fetch is this document's, not the code's.

And the timeouts are not about abort. Of 3,044 unpassed subtests in
`harness_timeout` files, **1,392 (113 files) need a wptserve `.py` handler** and
the remaining 1,652 are a thin per-file tail of one to eighteen. There is no
abort cluster.

So **fixing abort would not deliver ~3,000 subtests**, and the estimate built on
that row — "grind + fetch reaches 91%" — is withdrawn. The reason to build
concurrent subresource fetching is the one §B20.15 gave in the first place: real
page latency, judged by `corpus/compare.py`, not by WPT arithmetic. This entry
exists because the row would otherwise send the next reader to build abort for
subtests that are not there, which is exactly the §B13.3 failure — a number
travelling further than the caveat attached to it.

### B23.4 The prelude budget is not a performance guard, measured

`examples/perf` puts `prelude run` at **15.9 ms of a 16.2 ms later realm**, so it
is the right phase to care about. A deliberately padded 50 KiB build puts the
slope at **40-52 us/KiB**, consistent with the 45 the budget test already quotes.

But the run-to-run spread on this machine is **+/-4 ms on a 16 ms measurement**,
so **even an 18% size delta is not statistically resolvable** (t ~ 1.2). A few
KiB is far below the noise floor, and the constant in the test was left alone: a
point estimate that could not be confirmed should not overwrite a documented one.

What the budget actually does is force the question, and it did so twice here:
it pushed the interface-prototype mirror into the `conformance` tier where pages
pay nothing, and it found **3.9 KiB of the reflection table writing every
attribute name twice** — 139 entries of `["foo", "foo"]`, 72 more with a type
after them, and fifteen copies of three ARIA option objects. Keep it tight for
that reason, not because a KiB is measurably slow.

### B23.5 What the work was, and where the grind now stands

The gains, and what each was actually caused by — in every case something
smaller and more structural than the count suggested:

    custom-elements   2,423 -> 2,987   `cloneNode` built the element before
                                       copying attributes, so `is` arrived too
                                       late; that ordering held all 333 of
                                       builtin-coverage, now 444/444
    html/dom         62,183 -> 62,563  five reflection attributes, not 388 bugs
    dom               3,390 ->  3,682  `classList` wrote through `api.setAttr`,
                                       so no MutationObserver ever saw it
    css/cssom         2,133 ->  2,334  the inline declaration returned the text
                                       the author typed, not its serialisation
    url                 184 ->    377  `username`/`password` were constants; the
                                       parser had carried both all along
    css/selectors     2,648 ->  2,839  `:heading` is h1-h6 and needed no matcher
    html/semantics    9,604 ->  9,768
    css/cssom-view      568 ->    599

Two engine finds deserve their own line. `new MyElement()` threw for **every**
custom element, autonomous ones included — a page constructing a component
rather than calling `createElement` got `Illegal constructor`. And `Node.contains`
and `Node.compareDocumentPosition` were each defined **twice** in the same class,
so the earlier pair had never run; the dead `compareDocumentPosition` was an
approximation and the survivor is the spec's full bit field, which is why
nothing had noticed.

One speed result: `el.style` builds a fresh `StyleDeclaration` per access, so
`_read()` re-split the whole attribute per property read. Memoising on the
declaration text takes `el.style.color` from **33 us to 13 us** and
`getPropertyValue` from **21 us to 5 us** against `main`.

**Where the grind stands.** ~15,000 reachable subtests remain with no decision in
the way, and the shape has changed: **half of them sit in 2,842 files at one to
five subtests each**, against 7,900 in 153 files. The concentrated end that this
branch and §B22 lived on is essentially spent. 80% needs +4,600 from the tail,
which is a different activity at a different rate — and 88.5% remains the ceiling
with every §B6 and §B20.15 boundary standing, minus whatever §B23.3 takes off it.

Nothing was excluded to move a number; `tiers.list` is untouched.

### B23.6 The Chromium comparison, re-measured — and two public claims corrected

The benchmark table in §B13 predates this engine having a JavaScript engine, so
it was re-run: same machine, medians of seven **interleaved** runs after a
discarded warm-up, peak summed RSS across the process tree at 5 ms, and a third
page **built by script** — the case the old table excluded on purpose and can no
longer exclude. Both engines were checked to produce identical output on that
page before anything was timed.

| | small (1 KB) | docs (22 KB) | app (script-built) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| h5i | **46 ms / 51.7 MB** | **59 ms / 65.6 MB** | 248 ms / **87.4 MB** |
| `headless_shell` | 172 / 456.8 | 176 / 461.5 | **176 ms** / 464.4 |
| chromium | 672 / 1150.7 | 758 / 1153.8 | 824 / 1150.6 |

Three corrections, and the third is the one that mattered:

* **"~5x faster" was too high.** 3.0-3.7x on pages without script. The site and
  README now say ~3x.
* **"~80% less peak memory" was too low.** 85.8-88.7%. Now ~86%, and it is the
  figure to trust most: it is a property of the architecture — one process, no
  renderer, no GPU process — rather than of a workload, and it holds on all
  three pages.
* **"No JavaScript. Pages that render only via script will come back empty" was
  false**, and had been since Boa and the DOM prelude landed. It *understated*
  the product. What replaces it is the honest shape: JavaScript runs, and it is
  the slow half — on the script page this engine is **slower** than
  `headless_shell`, because Boa interprets where V8 compiles. Isolated:
  `--script` costs nothing on a page with no script (46 ms against 45), and
  44 ms -> 248 ms on the app page.

The claims lived in ten places across `README.md`, `docs/index.html`,
`docs/features/index.html` and `docs/pitch/index.html`, which is its own lesson:
a number repeated in ten hand-written pages goes stale in ten places at once.

**One number left alone and flagged rather than edited.** The pitch deck says
"300k+ web standards tests passed". That is §B13.2's 333,690, and §B13.3 and
§B19.2 exist because roughly 70% of it is one behaviour — encoding a character
into a URL — repeated once per codepoint. `tiers.list` was built so a claim
would not be made that way. Core alone is ~93,500. Changing what the deck
advertises is a product decision, not a measurement one, so it is named here and
left to the owner.

### B23.7 What the profiling found on the way

Two hot paths, both measured against `main` rather than against intuition:

* **`classList.add` cost 100 us** against 2 us for the `setAttribute` under it —
  35 ms of an 88 ms component page, the largest single JS cost in the profile.
  `_all()` tokenised with a regex into a `Set` and back out through a spread
  (43 us for a two-word string), and the indexed proxy sat in front of every
  internal `this._node` read inside every method. Hand-rolled tokenising plus
  binding methods to the target: **25 us and 10 us**, page 91 ms -> 69 ms.
* **`el.style.color` cost 33 us** against 1 us for `getAttribute`, because
  `el.style` builds a fresh declaration per access and `_read()` re-split the
  whole attribute per property read. Memoised on the declaration text:
  **13 us**, and `getPropertyValue` 21 us -> 5 us.

The second one is worth keeping for how it was nearly got wrong: the first fix
cached on the `StyleDeclaration`, which is thrown away immediately, so it never
hit — and the regression it was "fixing" did not exist, because the comparison
was against `getAttribute` rather than against `main`. **Three times on this
branch a single run said something that seven runs did not.**

# Build logs: the remote runner and the detection lane

R13 and D14, the step-by-step orders with their "Built" annotations.
`design-runner.md` and `design-detect.md` keep the design sections (R1 to R12b,
D1 to D13); this is the record of the work landing.

## B24. Four reports from an XSS lab, 2026-09-05

h5i-dev/h5i#609 to #612, all found while writing a `websec` tutorial and all
the same kind of problem: the engine did the *work* and told nobody, so a real
finding read as no finding. That is the worst failure mode a security tool has,
and three of the four were one root cause.

### B24.1 The events that were decided and never delivered

`<img src=x onerror=…>` and `<svg onload=…>` are the two commonest XSS payload
shapes there are, and against this engine both did nothing. #609 reported it as
"inline handlers never fire", which is not what was wrong: the handler compiled,
`el.onerror` read back as a function, and `<button onclick>` worked. What was
missing was underneath — **element-level `load` and `error` were never
dispatched at all** (#610, which reported the same hole through
`addEventListener` and so pointed straight at it).

Blitz fetches subresources through the document's `NetProvider`, hands the bytes
to layout, and drops the outcome. So the 404 was in the request log and nothing
in the page could see it. The fix is a `ResourceLog` the provider writes as each
fetch completes, keyed by both the URL asked for and the URL answered, because a
redirected image is `src` in the markup and the final URL in the outcome. The
realm reads it through `api.resourceStatus` and sweeps the elements that name a
resource, firing once per URL an element holds — so a changed `src` arms it
again, and re-running the sweep costs nothing. `<script src>` is fetched by
`run_scripts` rather than by the provider and had to be recorded there by hand;
missing that line would have left exactly one subresource kind silent.

The sweep runs **after layout, not before**, and that ordering is the whole of
why it works for script-added elements: Blitz starts the fetch when it resolves
the tree, so an `<img>` a script appended has no outcome until the layout pass
has run. Bounded at three passes, because a page whose `onerror` appends a
broken image is a loop.

### B24.2 The element nothing could click

The other half of #609, and a separate defect: `<div onclick=…>` has no implicit
role, so the snapshot walker gave it no line and no `@ref`, and the handler a
browser would run could not be fired from any verb. The report read that as "the
handler never fires"; it never *ran*, because nothing could reach it.

It gets its own role word, `clickable`, rather than being called a button. It is
not one — no keyboard activation, nothing a screen reader announces — and
reporting it as a button would be this engine disagreeing with the accessibility
tree to save a word. Pointer-activation attributes only: `<div onmouseover>` is
not something `click` applies to, and a ref there offers a verb that does
nothing. It is also the one ref-taking role that still hoists, because a
clickable card is a wrapper that happens to carry a handler, and swallowing its
heading and its link into one line would lose more than the ref is worth.

### B24.3 §B20.13's boundary, revisited

§B20.13 built the submission algorithm and stopped: "Neither *navigates*, and
that is deliberate rather than unfinished." #611 is what that costs. A form
never submitted, by either route — `form.submit()` was callable, threw nothing
and did nothing — so a login or a checkout could not be driven and a POST CSRF
could not be shown end to end.

The reasoning behind the boundary was right and the boundary was in the wrong
place. What this engine cannot allow is a page *navigating out from under a
verb*: an agent mid-read must not have the document change under it. It does not
follow that the request must never be made. So the realm records the request in
a `NavigationSlot` — the same slot Blitz's own submission algorithm fills, so
the two produce one request between them rather than two — and it goes out at
the verb boundary, through the broker, receipted like everything else, with the
reply carrying `page_submitted` so an agent knows every `@ref` it holds is
stale. A form that submits on load is followed by the `PageFactory`, bounded at
three hops, and the page says so in a note.

Half of #611 was also not a bug. "Clicking a submit button sends nothing" was a
click on `@e1`, which was the text field; `@e2` submitted correctly. Worth
recording, because the report was otherwise accurate and the reproduction was
the part that was wrong.

The encoding lives in Rust rather than in the prelude, which is not only about
the size budget: `encode_form_body` is now the one implementation of what a form
sends, shared with the multipart machinery `websec replay` already had.

### B24.4 §B17.2's refusal, made opt-out

`no-cors` with `credentials: "include"` was "refused outright", and §B17.2's
reason still holds: an opaque response cannot be checked, so a credential sent
with one could never be shown to have been permitted. #612 is the other side of
it. That shape *is* the classic POST-CSRF, so an engine that always refuses it
cannot act as the **victim** in a CSRF test, and its refusal reads as a clean
result. A negative meant "h5i declined", not "the target is safe".

A `cors::Stance` on the policy decides it, and only that: a cross-origin `cors`
read still has to be permitted by the server, and `same-origin` mode still
refuses to cross. `--permissive-cors` is fixed at session creation, folded into
the policy digest, and printed on the `open` banner and in `h5i browser status`
— a mode that changes what a page may do with a credential and does not announce
itself is the kind of quiet difference that makes a result unreproducible. The
refusal now names the flag, because a refusal an agent cannot act on is how a
declined test becomes a passed one.

One limit stated rather than papered over: the flag makes the session *willing*
to send a credential, not able to invent one. The jar holds only the origin
currently loaded and drops the rest on navigation, so a cross-*host* attack page
has nothing of the target's to send. Two ports on one host are two origins and
one jar, which is the shape a local CSRF lab has.

## R13. The order

Each step is small enough to land alone and each has an exit that is a
demonstration, not a diff.

- **R13.1 Pair and probe.** New crate `crates/h5i-runner` beside `h5i-share`
  (codec, typed messages, client, worker loop, and a `Transport` trait with
  `SshTransport` and `ChildProcessTransport`), feature-gated like `share`;
  `src/cli/runner.rs` on the `share.rs` template; `serve-stdio` in the same
  binary. Exit: `pair` then `probe` against a real second machine returns a
  capabilities report with a functional `verify_exec`, and the whole
  handshake also runs in CI with no sshd via the child-process transport.
  The exit is as much the failure modes as the happy path, tested where
  the child-process transport makes them cheap: an oversized frame, a
  truncated frame, an unknown frame type, a message out of order, an RPC
  total-byte limit exceeded, a `HELLO` that never arrives, a version
  mismatch, capability values that are hostile or absurd (clamped or
  refused, never stored), and a disconnect mid-transfer that leaves
  nothing behind. A codec born with its failure modes tested does not
  acquire them later as bug reports.

  **Built, 2026-08-16** (`crates/h5i-runner`, `src/cli/runner.rs`,
  `tests/runner_protocol.rs`): 92 unit tests and 17 integration tests, the
  latter against the real binary over a real process boundary. Pairing,
  probing, listing and unpairing all run end to end over real SSH against
  a real sshd, and the security properties were measured rather than
  assumed. With the pair key: a shell request returns nothing, and a
  forwarded port carries no bytes while the same forward on an
  unrestricted key returns the sshd banner — `restrict` is doing what the
  section claims. The `SHA256:` fingerprint h5i prints is byte-identical
  to `ssh-keygen -lf` on the machine, which is the only check pairing's
  trust-on-first-use ever gets, and it is a test rather than a hope.
  Session-per-RPC is cheap as R4 assumed: five multiplexed sessions in
  39 ms, about 8 ms each, against 343 ms each without a master.

  Four things the build found that the design had not:

  - **The watchdog kills a child, not a process group.** A reader
    unblocks when the last holder of the pipe's write end closes it, so a
    child that leaves a grandchild holding it keeps blocking past the
    kill. Both real transports are single-process by construction, so the
    kill is sufficient — but it is a property of *those transports*, not
    of the watchdog, and it is now written where the next transport will
    read it.
  - **The receiver's budget is the one that governs, and it is not the
    format's.** A control session refuses at 256 KiB, well under the
    1 MiB frame ceiling. Both sides of that boundary are pinned, because
    a cap is where an off-by-one lives.
  - **`CARGO_PKG_VERSION` in a library is the library's version.** The
    worker reported `0.1.0` to an operator running h5i 0.3.4, in the one
    field whose whole job is answering "which h5i is over there". The
    binary now supplies its own.
  - **A control socket path can be too long to be a socket.** Unix socket
    paths cap around a hundred bytes and a deep `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
    exceeds it, so multiplexing is declined rather than guessed at when
    it would not fit. Losing latency is better than an obscure OpenSSH
    error on someone else's machine.
- **R13.2 Create and destroy.** Bundle transfer, digest verification,
  leases and `gc`, the `creating/` to `live/` state machine and idempotent
  re-send (R7). Exit: `box create --runner`, `box ls` showing placement,
  destroy and gc leave the runner clean, a kill -9 of the client mid-create
  leaves only a `creating/` entry the next invocation reaps, and re-sending
  the same create after a lost `CREATE_RESULT` returns the same box instead
  of a second one.

  **Worker side built, 2026-08-16** (`boxstore`, `source`, the create,
  destroy, list and gc handlers, `h5i runner boxes|destroy|gc`): 139 unit
  tests and 24 integration tests against the real binary, plus an opt-in
  `H5I_TEST_RUNNER_SSH` test that runs the whole cycle over real SSH — a
  repository bundled here, streamed across an SSH session, checked out on
  the far side at the pinned commit, re-sent idempotently, destroyed. The
  source is a `git bundle` and neither side pollutes a branch namespace to
  build or read one; `git clone` cannot be used because it only sees
  `refs/heads/*`, so building a bundle would mean creating a branch in the
  repository we are supposed to be only reading. Bundles carry full history:
  `git bundle create` has no `--depth` (checked against git 2.43), and this
  is the first thing to revisit when the transfer becomes the slow part.

  **Complete, 2026-08-17.** `h5i box create --runner <name>` places a box on
  a paired runner: the base is pinned, the branch created and the policy
  resolved and digested here, the source goes across as a bundle, and the
  manifest records `runner_id` — the runner's host-key hash — beside a
  display name that is never identity. `box ls` shows `on=<runner>`, and
  `box rm` removes both sides. Verified against a real sshd end to end: the
  box's source arrives at the identical commit, `h5i runner boxes` shows it
  from the runner's own side, and removal clears both.

  The seam is a trait, `h5i_core::placement::RemoteRunner`, implemented in
  the binary over `h5i-runner`. `h5i-core` gets no dependency on the runner
  protocol, which matters because a later milestone will want the *worker*
  reaching for receipts and export — a dependency the other way would be a
  cycle waiting to happen. It also makes the remote create path testable in
  `h5i-core` against a fake that opens no connection.

  Operations that need a local workspace refuse a runner box by name rather
  than failing on a missing directory, because a message about a directory
  sends someone looking for a bug that is not there.

  Five things building it found:

  - **The container tier has no warm form**, which R7 assumed it did. See
    the correction there.
  - **A budget has to be per RPC.** A handshake is bytes and a bundle is
    megabytes, and one budget covering both has to be as loose as the looser
    of the two. `FrameReader::begin_rpc` resets the limits and the counters
    together; a reader whose bound silently changed with the traffic would
    have no bound at all.
  - **Reading a peer's stderr means waiting for the drain thread.** A child
    can write its diagnosis and exit while the draining thread is still
    between a `read` and the buffer, so reading the buffer without joining
    returns an empty string exactly when the message matters most. It passed
    locally for a whole milestone before more work made the race visible.
  - **`rm` has to remove this side first.** The tidier-looking order — clear
    the runner, then the local record — is wrong, because `rm` refuses a live
    box: the runner's copy was destroyed and the user was then told the
    removal had failed, leaving a local record pointing at nothing. Local
    first means the only remaining failure is an orphan on the runner, which
    is exactly what a lease is for. Found by running it, not by reading it.
  - **The effective baseline is about a local invocation.** It describes the
    Landlock grants and binds a kernel-tier run would apply on *this*
    machine, against a work directory a runner box does not have here.
    Computing one would be describing a confinement nobody is going to
    enforce.
- **R13.3 Exec.** Captured and interactive, the three clocks, the per-box
  locks, receipts in the `runner-observed` lane with the worker's egress
  summary. Exit: a real project's build and test suite runs on the runner
  from `env run` under its egress allowlist, `box shell` is usable over a
  deliberately laggy link, and the receipt log shows the lane and the
  egress evidence. Deliberately **not** an agent: an agent profile needs
  model credentials, R12 refuses to ship them, and an exit criterion that
  contradicts R12 is how the credential channel would end up rushed. The
  agent-on-a-runner demonstration belongs to the credential channel's own
  milestone.

  **Captured exec built, 2026-08-17.** `h5i box run <box> -- <cmd>` runs on
  the runner and comes home with an exit code, timings and the runner's own
  egress summary, filed under `runner-observed` — its own lane in `Signals`,
  neither host-observed nor box-claimed, for the reason R10 gives. The
  worker calls `sandbox::run_with_env` directly, which is the R3 cut paying
  off: the confinement that runs there is the product's own, not a
  reimplementation. Per-box locks are `flock` (create/destroy/export
  exclusive, exec shared), so an export beside a running build is refused
  rather than reading a torn tree — and the kernel releases the lock with
  the process, which is what stops a worker killed mid-exec from wedging a
  box forever. Verified over real SSH: output returns, exit codes
  propagate, receipts land.

  **Two pieces of this milestone are NOT built, and neither is disguised.**

  - *Output is captured, not streamed.* `run_with_env` is the function the
    local path calls and it captures; a long build says nothing until it
    finishes. The frames are already the right shape — `EXEC_STARTED` goes
    out before the run, and output arrives as `STDOUT`/`STDERR` chunks — so
    a streaming runner inside `h5i-sandbox` would send the same frames
    earlier. That is surgery on the local path's most load-bearing
    function and was deliberately not bundled in here.
  - *`box shell` on a runner does not work.* Interactive means a pty, and a
    pty means bidirectional streaming, resize and signals — the
    `PTY_IN`/`PTY_OUT`/`RESIZE`/`SIGNAL` frames are declared and refused.
    The "usable over a laggy link" half of the exit criterion is therefore
    **not met**, and stays open rather than being quietly reworded.
- **R13.4 Export. Built, 2026-08-17.** Exit met: a change made through
  `box run` on the runner round-trips to a host-authored mediated commit,
  survives the violation scans, and applies through the unchanged gates —
  demonstrated end to end against a real sshd, including a planted nested
  repository that is refused fail-closed with the branch left untouched.

  Two things turned out to be much smaller than the plan assumed, and one
  larger:

  - **`diff` and `apply` needed no changes at all.** `diff` already picks
    an object-store branch when there is no worktree, and every gate in
    `apply` is object-store work. Once the fetched tree lands on the env
    branch, the whole downstream is the local path unchanged.
  - **The `mediated_commit` refactor was not needed either.** The tree
    arrives already committed by the worker, so what this side needs is not
    a tree-source variant of a function that stages a worktree — it is the
    scans, run against a tree, and a commit. Those live in
    `h5i_core::quarantine`, and the local `mediated_commit` is untouched.
    R13's scope valve therefore never had to be pulled.
  - **The quarantine was the real work**, and it is the part R9 cares
    about. The bundle is unpacked into a throwaway *bare* repository with
    its own object database — a ref namespace withholds reachability, not
    presence, so it is not a quarantine — and the structural checks run
    there: object and entry counts, a blob ceiling, path length, traversal,
    nested `.git`, and gitlinks the base did not have. Only then does the
    surviving tree cross, carried by a commit that is discarded on arrival
    so that **this side authors the commit**. Verified: the runner's own
    carrier commit appears nowhere in the host repository's history.

  The bundle home is **thin** (`base..tip`), which is why the quarantine is
  seeded with the base from the repository we own before the untrusted
  bundle is fetched. An export therefore costs what was *done* in the box
  rather than what the history weighs — the asymmetry the outbound
  direction cannot have, because the far side starts with nothing.

  (Superseded exit text, kept for the record: a change made through `box
  shell` or `env run` on the runner round-trips to a host-authored mediated
  commit, survives the violation
  scans (a planted nested-git and a private-path write are both filtered and
  named), and applies through the unchanged gates.

Decision points, named not resolved:

1. **The lane name.** `runner-observed` as a third lane string, against
   overloading `Grade` to express transport trust. The third string is
   recommended: the two axes are orthogonal today and should stay so.
2. **The runner in the digest.** Digesting `runner` binds a box permanently
   to its runner name and forecloses migrating a box between runners without
   export and re-create. Recommended anyway: identity over convenience, and
   export/re-create *is* the migration story this product believes in.

   **Answered, 2026-08-16, by dissolving the premise.** The digest never
   holds the name; it holds `runner_id`, the hash of the pinned host key
   (R6). That keeps the binding (to the machine, which is what the digest
   was reaching for) and drops the false one (to a label anyone can
   re-point at different hardware). The migration answer is unchanged:
   export and re-create.
3. **R13.4's scope valve.** The tree-source refactor is the only invasive
   change; if it fights back, the MVP ships export-only (the detached-box
   posture) and apply lands behind the refactor later. Nothing upstream of
   R13.4 depends on which way this goes.

   **Answered, 2026-08-17: never needed.** The refactor was predicated on
   this side having to build a tree from a worktree it does not have. It
   does not have to: the worker commits, and what arrives is a tree. So the
   work was the quarantine and the scans, `mediated_commit` was left alone,
   and apply landed with the rest. The valve was never pulled because there
   was nothing to valve.

## D14. The order

1. **D14.1 — The crate skeleton.** `crates/h5i-bpf`: probe, event model,
   rules and evidence types, all pure Rust, compiling on every target in the
   release matrix. No aya yet. *Exit: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`
   green on Linux and Darwin; the rules engine unit-tested against synthetic
   event streams.*
2. **D14.2 — The probe.** `bpf/h5i_detect.bpf.c` plus the build script that
   compiles it when `clang` can target BPF, stubs it when it cannot, and hard
   fails under `H5I_BPF_REQUIRE=1`. *Exit: the object builds on this host and
   `bpftool`-less verification that its sections and maps are what the loader
   expects.*
3. **D14.3 — The loader.** aya session: load, verify tracepoint formats, program
   the scope, attach, read the ring buffer, stop and account. Linux only, and
   behind `h5i-bpf/load`, which is **off by default like every other switch in
   this lane** — see D11 on why the crate default is the one that is easiest to
   get wrong. The dedicated CI job is what asks for it, and therefore what lints
   and tests it. *Exit: `detect probe` reports the host truthfully — including
   "missing CAP_BPF" on an unprivileged one — and the live attach test passes as
   root.*
4. **D14.4 — The run seam.** Wire the session around `sandbox::run_with_env`
   in `env run` and `env shell`, resolve the scope per tier, and put the block
   in the receipt. *Exit: a run under a `detect`-enabled profile carries a
   `runtime` block; a run on a host without the capability carries the block
   with its reason; `require = true` refuses.*
5. **D14.5 — The surfaces.** Policy parsing, `h5i box detect` verbs, the
   console row, the export report, `box status`, `box capabilities`, MANUAL,
   SECURITY, and the generated manuals regenerated. *Exit: the docs job is
   green, which is the only way the CLI and the manual can agree.*

### D14.6. What was demonstrated, and what was not

All five steps are built, 2026-08-19. Stated precisely, because "built" and
"demonstrated" are not the same word:

**Demonstrated.**

- The probe compiles with `clang -target bpf -O2 -g -Wall -Werror` and produces
  the seventeen tracepoint programs, the five maps, the `license` section and
  `.BTF`. `tests/detect_integration.rs` builds it under `H5I_BPF_REQUIRE=1`,
  which is the setting that turns "no clang" into a build failure.
- The wire contract is held from both ends: a compile-time size assertion on
  the Rust struct, a magic-and-version check on every record, and a test that
  parses the C header and compares every constant and every event-kind number
  against the Rust enum. A third test parses the probe source and fails if it
  declares a tracepoint program the loader's attach table does not name.
- The rules engine is tested against synthetic event streams — every rule
  fires, and a table-driven test fails if a rule is listed in the catalogue and
  unreachable from `observe`. Both directions of each judgement call are
  covered: a LAN address *is* egress, loopback is not, the proxy's own endpoint
  is not, a granted `unix_sockets` profile is not reported for using them, a
  box reading *its own* `/proc/<pid>/environ` is not reported.
- The end-to-end wiring is tested on a host with **no** `CAP_BPF`, which is the
  common case and the one most likely to be got wrong: a profile that did not
  ask carries no block, a profile that asked carries a block with the reason,
  `require = true` refuses the run and names the setting, a misspelled rule id
  surfaces in the receipt, and enabling detection changes the pinned policy
  digest.

**Not demonstrated.** The attach itself. Loading a program and binding it to a
tracepoint needs `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON`, which this machine's h5i does not
have and which `cargo test` should not acquire. That path lives in
`crates/h5i-bpf/tests/live_attach.rs`, behind `H5I_BPF_LIVE=1`, and it skips
*loudly* — printing the reason — rather than passing quietly. Until somebody
runs it on a host with the capability, the honest claim is: the probe compiles,
the loader is written against a pinned aya, the verifier has not seen it.

Two specific things that first run is checking, both stated so a failure is
diagnosable rather than surprising:

1. **The verifier's opinion of the `openat` program**, which is the big one at
   roughly ten thousand instructions after the prefix loop and the `/.env` scan
   are unrolled. Well inside the one-million limit, and the largest unverified
   thing here.
2. **The tracepoint field offsets**, which the loader checks against
   `/sys/kernel/tracing/events/.../format` when that file is readable. It
   usually is not (tracefs is root-only), in which case the documented layout
   is used and the check is skipped — never silently, the probe report says
   `tracefs = no` and what that costs.

# The remote runner: the adversarial review, 2026-08-17

The round-by-round record. `design-runner.md` R12b keeps the four rules that
came out of it and now govern the code.

## R12b. What an adversarial review of the built code found

Eighteen rounds against the branch, 2026-08-17, with the threat model the rest
of this part states: **the runner may be compromised**, so the interesting
direction is runner to host. Thirty-seven findings, all fixed. The two that
mattered most were things the design had reasoned about correctly and the code
had not implemented that way.

**A box could execute on the runner host.** The export staged a box's work by
running `git add` inside the box's own repository, and git executes
`core.fsmonitor` and `filter.<name>.clean` out of repository config, which the
box owns because its workspace is bind-mounted rw. `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`
covers neither. Any box with a shell could run a command as the runner user. The
fix is not another flag: it is not invoking the CLI in a tree whose
configuration is hostile.

**A refspec is not a limit on what a fetch writes.** git follows tags by
default, so a crafted bundle put an attacker-named `refs/tags/*` and a
runner-authored tag object into the host repository, on the success path, past
every check the quarantine performs. R9's sentence about the host only ever
containing commits it authored was false for tags. `--no-tags` and
`--no-write-fetch-head` close it.

Three more were gaps between what a section said and what the code did. The
capability gate validated the tier a request *declared* while `run_with_env`
dispatches on the tier its *policy* carries, so a box could be recorded as
`container` and run every command unconfined. R12's refusal of
credential-bearing profiles was written down and never implemented: values never
crossed, but the runner resolves grant descriptors against its own environment,
so a box could be handed the runner's credential. And the SSH argv's claim not
to depend on `~/.ssh/config` was false, with no `-F` and `GlobalKnownHostsFile`
unpinned, so a hostile config redirected every RPC to another machine with the
pin apparently intact. That breaks the attestation, not merely the transport,
because `runner_id` is what a manifest records.

Several of the fixes were themselves wrong, which is the part worth
generalising. Two were caught by the tests they broke. Three survived until a
round was spent reviewing the *fixes* rather than the code, and one was the
second-worst finding of the review:

- **The move to libgit2 was half a fix.** It closed the half of the
  hostile-config class that *executes* commands and left the half that
  *redirects*. libgit2 honours `core.worktree`, so a box could point the
  export's staging at any path the runner user can read and have another box's
  workspace packed into its own bundle; and a `.git` file carrying a `gitdir:`
  pointer makes the export commit into a different repository. "This library
  does not run commands" answers a smaller question than "this library does not
  act on hostile configuration".
- **One fix's commit message described work its diff never did.** The
  `authorized_keys` check was claimed to match whole lines and did not, and the
  branch that claimed to refuse was unreachable. A false claim in a commit
  message is worse than the bug, because it is what the next reader trusts.
- **One fix reverted an older one.** Setting `service_digest` to `None` for a
  runner box re-armed a legacy-env sentinel a previous security fix had closed,
  under a comment still asserting the invariant held.

That is the argument for the fuzz harnesses this round added over the codec and
the worker's state machine, and for spending a round on the fixes rather than
only on the code. Reviewing a patch is not the same activity as reviewing a
system, and the second does not subsume the first.

# Related work, read in full

The surveys behind `design-runner.md` R2 and `design-detect.md` D3. The
decisions they produced live
there; this is what was read.

## The remote runner: E2B and bhatti

From **E2B**, the exec stream's discipline: a mandatory first frame
acknowledging the spawn, separate from output; input, resize and signals as
separate calls addressed by process id; keepalive cadence declared by the client
and echoed as frames; capability gating against named version constants, so the
constants file doubles as the protocol changelog. Refused: the entire plane.
Control-plane REST, envd-in-guest HTTP, tokens minted at create and
Connect-over-HTTP framing all exist because E2B's client and sandbox meet across
the public internet. Ours meet across an SSH session we already authenticated.

From **bhatti**, the frame protocol nearly verbatim (R5); file transfer reusing
the same stdio frames rather than a second mechanism; create errors carrying the
tail of the far-side log; a server-side default and maximum on every exec
timeout; and the shutdown posture that prefers an un-reaped live box to an
unrecoverable dead one. Refused: the resident daemon, the bearer-token listener,
the WebSocket TTY relay, the quota machinery, the thermal state machine.

One bhatti finding is load-bearing: it moved its internal API off loopback TCP
onto a unix socket after a sandbox reached the daemon's loopback listener. The
forced command over SSH stdio is the end of that trajectory: **no listener
anywhere, of any kind, ever.**

## The detection lane: Tracee and Tetragon

Both solve this at a scale h5i does not have.

From **Tracee**: the split between a **collector** that knows only events and a
**signature layer** that knows only semantics, so rules never touch a ring
buffer and the collector never learns what a credential file is; the insistence
that a dropped event is reported rather than smoothed over, which is why
`events_lost` sits next to `events_seen`; and argument capture at `sys_enter`
with an explicit bounded string budget. Refused: the event catalogue, since
hundreds of instrumented events need CO-RE plus a full BTF toolchain and a
detector that costs a second toolchain is a detector nobody builds; and the
daemon, since h5i has none by design and the unit of observation here is a run,
not a host.

From **Tetragon**, one idea and one warning. The idea is
**process-lineage-as-first-class**: the tree is maintained in the kernel rather
than reconstructed by racing `/proc`, which is exactly D6's scope mechanism,
because by the time userspace reads `/proc/<pid>` a short-lived `postinstall`
is gone. The warning is enforcement: Tetragon can kill from a hook, and h5i does
not take that (D12). A detector that sometimes blocks is a policy layer with
unclear semantics, and h5i already has one with clear semantics.
