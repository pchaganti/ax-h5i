//! `h5i browser`: the front door.
//!
//! One noun an agent learns: a *session*. `open` makes one, points the default
//! at it, and every later verb follows that pointer.
//!
//! ```text
//! h5i browser open https://example.com
//! h5i browser snapshot
//! h5i browser click @e3
//! ```
//!
//! The opaque id (`br_7k2xqa`) is what `--json` and the receipts carry, since a
//! durable reference must survive a rename, and is not what anyone types.
//! `--session <name>` runs several at once; a name is reusable once its session
//! ends, which is why the id is what gets written down.
//!
//! Containment is a placement, not a product. With no flags the session runs in
//! this user's process space like any other headless browser, and what it does
//! that others do not is *record*. `--in <box>` moves the same session into a
//! box, changing only who saw the network: the lane goes from engine-claimed to
//! host-observed ([`h5i_core::browser_session::Lane`]).
//!
//! Verbs are carried in over `h5i box run` rather than dialled, because a
//! supervised box's netns puts the engine's loopback control port out of the
//! host's reach. Two things fall out, both wanted: every verb gets a receipt,
//! and the control lock is checked on the host, outside the box.
